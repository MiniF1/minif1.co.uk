            Grown Up
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I know I've been quiet for a while on here, but that's because I've been busy. Busy at work, but more
            importantly busy house-hunting. I've decided it's time to join the world of grown-ups and buy a house <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/09.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-o"/> I'm bored of renting, having
            to fit in with other people, pay money out and not get an awful lot back for it, and not be able to hang my
            own pictures or posters on the walls and personalise my room, for fear of losing a deposit.<br/>
            <br/>
            So I've been hunting now for about a month, I've looked at numerous houses in and around Southampton, and
            met lots of lovely people and some rather sad ones. Of all the houses I've looked at (probably ~20), 5 of
            them were up for sale because the couple who had bought it were splitting up. How sad is that? That's at
            least a quarter of the houses I saw that were for sale. No wonder there are so many new 1 &amp; 2 bed houses
            and flats being built at the moment, to cater for all these newly single people.<br/>
            <br/>
            Anyway, the good news is that I had an offer accepted on Tuesday! It's for a 3-bed semi in Sholing, a suburb
            of Southampton that's about halfway between work and the centre of Southampton. I'm trying not to let myself
            get too excited about it, in case it falls through (I've already lost out on 2 houses by being outbid, and
            the offer on this one is below the asking price so I can't rule out being gsumped). But I've already started
            planning what's going where... <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/04.png" width="18" height="18"
                                                alt=":-D"/><br/>
            <br/>
            It will need some work doing, so any volunteers for a bit of DIY? Come on, I know you all probably know more
            about home maintenance than me... hehe, that's not difficult! But that's what Dad's are for, isn't it? <img
