            Small stumbling block
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            It seems that Halifax was satisfied with the survey and have apparently issued a mortgage offer letter to my
            mortgage advisors. Which is all well and good, except they got the terms wrong. No wonder this house-buying
            thing takes so long if people can't even get the simple things right!<br/>
            <br/>
            Despite this, I've decided it's time to start chivvying things along now, as I've got some competition.
            Helen's parents are buying a house and they've just got a completion date of May 12, so I've decided to
            compete with them and see how quickly I can get mine to go through! Well, that was the plan, but I've been
            too busy at work to phone anyone and chase them... Ah well, we'll see how it goes <img class="inline"
                                                                                                   src="img/smilies/01.png"
                                                                                                   width="18"
                                                                                                   height="18"
                                                                                                   alt=":-)"/>

            These things move slowly, don't they?
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            A few things to report on the house-buying process. I had a small hiccup with the mortgage, in that a
            technical problem meant that my application was received after the rates went up. However, my mortgage
            advisor is negotiating cashback to the value of the rate uplift because he says he applied for it before the
            rates went up, so fingers crossed that will work out.<br/>
            <br/>
            I have just received the results of the survey/valuation (I went for the basic one) which say that the house
            is worth what I'm offering to pay for it and that they don't see any reason why the mortgage lender
            shouldn't lend me the money for it. Which is good! :) The only things it did note was that the house had
            experienced some movement, but that there is no evidence to suggest this is ongoing, and that it has been
            subject to draininage alterations and repair, and suggests that I should check that all necessary
            permissions and consents were obtained (whatever that means?).<br/>
            <br/>
            My solicitors have also taken money off me to begin the searches, so I assume that's underway. And that's
            about all I have to report with regard to the house for the time being.<br/>
            <br/>
            What else has been going on... Dad ran a 12-car event for the CSMA West Middlesex car club on Friday night
            which went very well. Steven &amp; Uncle Michael were Course Opening Car while Mum &amp; I were Course
            Closing Car, which meant we had to keep stopping to pick up code boards and close the marshal controls
            (although most of them were already closed by the time we got there). Fortuntely the bar was still open when
            we got back to the Finish, although it was a close call!<br/>
            <br/>
            After clearing up and getting back to the parents' at about 1am, I then had to get up at 7am to drive back
            down to Southampton on Saturday morning, as we had a situation at work that needed to be resolved. Me? Going
            in to work on a Saturday morning? What is the world coming to! <br/>
            <br/>
            We finally finished at about 12.30pm, at which time I had to rush across to Portsmouth as I was entered in
            the Portsmouth &amp; Havant Badminton Tournament. I played with Nigel, and after some close games (and some
            not so close) we finished joint 4th in our group (out of 6).<br/>
            <br/>
            And as if I haven't played enough badminton recently, I filled in for Wildern's Southampton A team this
            afternoon but we lost 5-3 to Notorious. However, the result may be subject to change as we may be lodging a
            protest because one of the girls in the Notorious team played against us for another team earlier in the
            season (funnily enough in one of the other games I filled in for). But we're not sure what the league rules
            say on the matter.<br/>
            <br/>
            So that's me for the moment - work, buying a house, badminton &amp; ralying about covers it. If anything
            else exciting happens, I'll keep you posted!

            House
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            There's not much to report at the moment regarding the house. That's the scary thing about these things;
            once you've said you want a house and have agreed a price it's out of your control. You're at the mercy of
            solicitors and mortgage lenders and can only keep your fingers crossed that it all goes ok! Which is pretty
            much the stage I'm at now.<br/>
            <br/>
            I sent off all the solicitor's forms last week, which hopefully they should have received now the Bank
            Holidays have passed. My mortgage advisor applied for my mortgage last week too, so the next stage there
            should be a survey/valuation by the mortgage company to verify that the house is worth what I've offered to
            pay for it and that it's not likely to fall down in the near future - I hope it passes muster <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/05.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-?"/><br/>
            <br/>
            I'll post any updates here as soon as anything happens, so watch this space.<br/>
            <br/>
            It does get frustrating though, trying not to get too excited about the house in case it all falls through.
            I've already mentally designed the new kitchen that I'd like to put in and decided how I'd like each room to
            look... I can't help myself! So any fingers and toes that you could keep crossed for me would be gratefully
            appreciated <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/03.png" width="18" height="18" alt=";-)"/>

            Grown Up
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I know I've been quiet for a while on here, but that's because I've been busy. Busy at work, but more
            importantly busy house-hunting. I've decided it's time to join the world of grown-ups and buy a house <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/09.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-o"/> I'm bored of renting, having
            to fit in with other people, pay money out and not get an awful lot back for it, and not be able to hang my
            own pictures or posters on the walls and personalise my room, for fear of losing a deposit.<br/>
            <br/>
            So I've been hunting now for about a month, I've looked at numerous houses in and around Southampton, and
            met lots of lovely people and some rather sad ones. Of all the houses I've looked at (probably ~20), 5 of
            them were up for sale because the couple who had bought it were splitting up. How sad is that? That's at
            least a quarter of the houses I saw that were for sale. No wonder there are so many new 1 &amp; 2 bed houses
            and flats being built at the moment, to cater for all these newly single people.<br/>
            <br/>
            Anyway, the good news is that I had an offer accepted on Tuesday! It's for a 3-bed semi in Sholing, a suburb
            of Southampton that's about halfway between work and the centre of Southampton. I'm trying not to let myself
            get too excited about it, in case it falls through (I've already lost out on 2 houses by being outbid, and
            the offer on this one is below the asking price so I can't rule out being gsumped). But I've already started
            planning what's going where... <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/04.png" width="18" height="18"
                                                alt=":-D"/><br/>
            <br/>
            It will need some work doing, so any volunteers for a bit of DIY? Come on, I know you all probably know more
            about home maintenance than me... hehe, that's not difficult! But that's what Dad's are for, isn't it? <img

            Prague
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Last weekend the intrepid threesome of myself, Helen &amp; Anna went off to investigate the delights of the
            capital of the Czech Republic, the wonderful city of Prague. We had a lovely, albeit rather cold (top temp
            of -4oC!) weekend, visiting all the sights (castle, churches, synagogues, Staropramen brewery...), having
            snowball fights, and testing the local cuisine. <br/>
            <br/>
            I'd recommend Prague (Praha to the locals) as a destination (50p a pint!), although not necessarily at this
            time of year... Having said that, it was fairly quiet on the tourist front which was nice, but we got the
            impression that it's jam packed in the summer.<br/>
            <br/>
            This was the first major outing for my new camera, and in 4 days I managed to take 123 pictures! I love
            digital cameras... <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/04.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-D"/>
            Unfortunately, I got back and tried to upload them here for all to see, only to discover that I have run out
            of space in my 100MB web server allowance <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/10.png" width="18"
                                                           height="18" alt=":angry:"/> So I'm afraid you'll have to wait
            a bit longer until I can figure out where I can host them, and the stack of other photos I haven't got
            around to displaying yet.<br/>
            <br/>
            Watch this space...

            To run, or not to run?
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Ok folks, time to test out my new blog Comments facility (ta Rick!). Today's poll: Should I (attempt to) run
            the Great North Run this year? <br/>
            <br/>
            Bearing in mind I hate running - but then I hated walking too and that didn't stop me trekking in the
            Annapurnas or hiking up the Inca Trail to Macchu Pichu, did it? I really can't decide if I want to put
            myself through the pain and the agony, albeit for both charity and personal achievement. Would you sponsor
            me if I chose a suitably worthy cause (i.e. not the Caroline Chocolate Fund)?<br/>
            <br/>
            It's not until September, so I have plenty of time to train, and it's only a half marathon...<br/>
            <br/>
            Help!

            Christmas all over again
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Christmas has come again for me as my best present arrived this week - my parents gave me some money towards
            a digital SLR camera, so I jumped straight on the net and spent the wonga on one of <a
                href="http://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/slr/eos_300d/index.asp">these little
            babies</a> <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/04.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-D"/> It's beautiful, a
            fantastic combination of my old 35mm SLR and my current Powershot A70 digital compact camera. I have the
            ability to frame shots again, and don't lose any quality when I zoom in, especially in low light, and if I
            don't like the picture, I simply erase it! Hence the reason I was able to take about 50 shots of my bedroom
            the other night on lots of different settings, view them instantly, then get rid of them! Pure magic <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"/><br/>
            <br/>
            It did take me a while to decide which one to buy, it was a tough choice between the Canon 300D and the
            Nikon D70, two very good cameras. After much deliberation and surfing the net for reviews, sample pictures
            etc., I finally decided that the Nikon wasn't worth the extra money to me and I am now the happy owner of my
            3rd Canon camera.<br/>
            <br/>
            So I expect you will be seeing plenty of photos up here soon as I will definitely be playing with it a lot!

            Season's Greetings!
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Merry Christmas and good will to all men (and women and children). My thoughts at this time are those who
            have friends or family involved in the South East Asian disaster. Of all the times for it to happen, during
            the Christmas period must be the worst of all. I hope that if you have heard nothing yet, the old saying 'no
            news is good news' may apply.<br/>
            <br/>
            So it's not long now until 2004 becomes past and 2005 becomes present. Here's hoping 2005 brings happier
            times for all of us. For my family &amp; I, 2004 has been a pretty hard year, one which I am sure I will
            remember for all the low points, including losing 2 dear grandparents, my brother being involved in a car
            crash, my housemate being involved in a boating accident, a colleague suffering two heart attacks, a friend
            being mugged in Vietnam on a moped and ending up in hospital, my aunt &amp; uncle separating... oh, and of
            course I can't forget the time when my boyfriend left me for another woman. An eventful year!<br/>
            <br/>
            However, this just makes me realise that I am very lucky, as I have 2 parents, a fantastic brother and lots
            of really good friends; plus I have recently moved to a lovely brand new flat, I have a nice car and a good
            job - what more could I ask for really? <br/>
            <br/>
            Well, having my grandparents back would be pretty cool but I guess their time was up, we can't live forever,
            and after all, we can't have everything we wish for!<br/>
            <br/>
            And all in all, this year hasn't been all bad. I mustn't forget that Steven graduated from university and
            has got himself a job (and two promotions already!), two dear friends have announced their engagements,
            three friends have made the jump and bought houses (how grown up!), I turned 25 (is that a highlight or a
            lowlight?), I have settled down in Southampton and made lots of new friends, the Hamble Hornets have taken
            off and are going strong (a football team made up from girls who worked on the marina)... and I could go on.<br/>
            <br/>
            So let's look on the bright side, remember the happy times and look forward to an exciting and prosperous
            new year - may 2005 bring hope and happinness to all who read this.<br/>
            <br/>
            ****MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR!!****

            Faith in BT is restored!
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I am now halfway to being connected to the world again! BT have been round today (2 rather nice young men

            funtioning phone line at last - only a month and a half late! Now I've just got to wait for ADSL to be

            Birthday cake anyone? I've enough to feed a small army of Ehtiopians. Well, maybe a very small army (after
            I've had my fill)...<br/>
            <br/>
            Well done to Dad &amp; Steven for their fantastic efforts in the Lombard Revival Rally last weekend - 18th
            out of 89 finishers (115 starters) after 3 days and 1400 miles around the British Isles is pretty good going
            in my estimations! And the car's got hardly a scratch on it... well done boys! But next year, can I drive?
            Please? <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/04.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-D"/> <br/>
