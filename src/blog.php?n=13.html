            I played my first badminton match for Wildern BC tonight, against Chandlers Ford. Carlos &amp; I won 15-4,
            15-13, then Janet and I took our Ladies game 15-3, 15-6. I thought they said this league would be tough!! I
            don't think the opposition had their strongest team out to be fair, but still! <img class="inline"
                                                                                                src="img/smilies/04.png"
                                                                                                width="18" height="18"
                                                                                                alt=":-D"/><br/>

            It's a shame I can't make friday night's match, but then it's not every day you get the chance to see Bryan
            Adams live. Ok, so he's not the hippest of artists, and is getting on a bit, but I did grow up listening to
            him (that was the summer of '69!) and seeing anyone playing live is a treat - come on guys, surely it's
            better than Take That &amp; Boyzone, the only other concerts I've been to!<br/>
            <br/>
            Then I've got Gemma &amp; Dan's Hallowe'en/Engagement party to look forward to on Saturday which should be a
            good laugh! And rumour has it, Heather's going to be there - a rare treat! Especially to have all three of
            us girlies in the same place at the same time (first time since we left uni I think!). I can't wait <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"/><br/>
            <br/>
            And then I guess I'd better start thinking about packing... Kerry &amp; I have got a new flat, hoorah! Our
            current landlord decided he wanted to sell our place, so we (well, mostly Kerry) went hunting and stumbled
            across a brand new development of flats over the road, so we snapped up the 2-bed penthouse suite <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"/> It's not even finished yet!
            They do keep assuring us it'll be ready for the 1st, when we move in... I want to get a sofabed bed in it so
            you guys can all come and visit and have somewhere to stay. No excuses now!
