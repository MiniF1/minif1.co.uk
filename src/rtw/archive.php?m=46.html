        First stop after Canberra was the Snowy Mountains (well they are in the winter apparently!) for scenic walks
        through alpine bushland on the top of Australias highest mountain (~2215m). It was very strange to see a ski
        resort in the summer but the Flora and Fauna were lovely, we took the easy route and got the chair lift up the
        mountain and walked back down through the changing scenery. <br/>
        <br/>
        From the mountains we headed to the coast and stopped overnight at a place called Eden where we took a nice
        morning stroll along the beach and the Wharf. We then spent the day aiming for Melbourne (~600km) but got side
        tracked by a nice National Park called Wilsons Promontory. We spent the next day here walking throught the
        temperate rainforest at the most southernly point on the Oz mainland, having a quick dip in the sea and
        utilising the shower facilities! That evening we went to teh Penguin Parade on Phillip Island where we sat
        watching (~5m away from the closest!) Little Penguins waddle up the beach towards their burrows in the sand
        dunes where you could get even closer to them (Galapagos style). <br/>
        <br/>
        The next day we stopped in Mornington (still on our way to Melbourne) which had a local craft market which we
        spent the morning exploring. That evening we finally made it to Melbourne via the coast road (through places
        such as Chelsea, Sandringham & Brighton!). After having gone all round the suburbs, so Caroline could see Albert
        Park (GP circuit), we spent the evening wandering round the centre of town and going up to the top of the
        Observation Deck for 360degree views of Melbourne and a nice sunset. We camped in the botanic gardens, just
        outside the town centre and walked in from here again this morning to continue our sightseeing. Todays
        highlights have been Captain Cooks house (shipped over brick by brick from Yorkshire!), a tour of Victoria's
        Parliament House, the Royal Exhibition Centre, a large pocket watch that opens on the hour (in the middle of a
        shopping centre of course), getting the van door fixed and a guided river walk learning about Aboriginal
        Melbourne.<br/>
