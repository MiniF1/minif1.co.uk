        We are now in Arica, the town in the very north of Chile, 20km from the border with Peru. Since we last wrote in
        Antofagasta, we have successfully avoided water poisoning (later found out there is arsenic in the local water
        supply!) and headed up the scenic coast road to Tocopilla. Had a bit of a drama here though - decided there
        wasn't anything we wanted to see in Tocopilla, we had only come here to do the scenic drive. However, the bus
        broke down and we were stuck here for several hours while various people tinkered with the engine. Still
        deciding to carry on we finally got going, only to break down again an hour down the road - this time it was
        terminal. Rather than waiting another hour for the next bus to come along and take us on to Iquique (still 3
        hours away, by now it was 7.30pm and we couldn?t see the coast any more) we flagged down a bus going back to
        Tocopilla and ended up staying the night there! It turned out quite well as we got a hotel with tv, private bath
        etc etc very cheap!<br/>
        <br/>
        Next day we caught the first bus to Iquique, arriving there around lunch. We spent the afternoon visiting a
        Naval Museum and a Regional Museum and wandering round the town (including looking inside the very posh and
        highly decorated Casa Espagna and feeling rather underdressed - we couldn?t quite bring ourselves to order a
        Pisco Sour!). We ate out that night in a nice restaurant and booked a tour for the next day to visit the
        surrounding area.<br/>
        <br/>
        The tour started at 9.30am and took us over the Cordillera del Costa (range of mountains lining the coast) and
        onto the Altiplano (very flat and empty). Here we visited the remnants of the saltpetre industry (still not
        quite sure what this is, some fertiliser we think) including Santa Laura (an old processing plant) and
        Humberstone (a ghost town). Then we visited some ancient petroglyphs (pictures on the mountainside drawn with
        rocks) of llamas, people, manta rays (!) etc dating back to 300AD. A late lunch was had in the oasis town of
        Pica, then we journeyed back via a few other typical towns to Iquique, from where we caught the bus this morning
        to Arica.<br/>
        <br/>
        So far we have climbed the obligatory hill in Arica for nice views over the bay and to the mountains and seen a
        bunch of pelicans in the harbour. We are planning to visit Lauca National Park (NE Chile) tomorrow.
