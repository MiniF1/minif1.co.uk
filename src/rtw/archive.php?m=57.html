        <div class="messageTitle">Kaikoura - Westport</div>
        Wow, we've done a lot since we last wrote in Kaikoura. We went sea-kayaking there with a pod of 30-40 dusky
        dolphins and also got to see the seals lazing around on the rocks, then went for a tour of an old limestone cave
        with cool formations. Next stop was the oh-so-english city of Christchurch where people were punting up and down
        the River Avon, complete with mallards! Here we visited another local museum and Air Force World with all its
        old planes and story of the RNZAF.<br/>
        <br/>
        Heading on down the east coast towards Dunedin we stopped at Timaru (DB Draught brewery, Richard Pearse memorial
        - potentially the first man to fly (into a hedge!), 8 months before the Wright brothers), Oamaru (home to little
        blue and yellow-eyed penguin colonies) and Moeraki (large marble-shaped rocks on the beach) along the way.<br/>
        <br/>
        Dunedin, supposedly a Scottish settlement, was not particularly scottish but very studenty! We visited Olveston
        House (still in the 1920's style) and the First Presbyterian Church (well, the second First church because the
        first one burnt down!). The Otago peninsula near Dunedin was home to the only mainland colony of albatrosses in
        the world, so we took a trip to see them (they were huge!) and the Disappearing Gun in Fort Taiaroa.<br/>
        <br/>
        We decided not to visit Invercargill and the south coast as we wanted plenty of time to spend in the Southern
        Alps, so from Dunedin we cut straight across the island to Te Anau. On the way we stopped one night at the end
        of a farm track to cook dinner, when the farmer came out and invited us to use his kitchen! This turned into him
        cooking for us, letting us use his shower, washing machine, tumble dryer and a large air mattress to sleep on
        his floor!<br/>
        <br/>
        In Te Anau we walked round NZ's deepest lake then took a trip across it to visit more glowworm caves. The next
        day we spent in Milford Sound sea-kayaking up and down the fjord looking up at impressive waterfalls and large
        mountains which loomed up straight out of the sea. Unfortunately it was on the way from here to Queenstown that
        we had a car crash (we're both ok fortunately). After staying in a backpackers in Te Anau that night we caught
        the bus the next day to Queenstown to try and pick up a replacement car. While waiting, Helen went for a long
        walk up towards Ben Lomond (a small mountain) for great views over the town and Lake Wakatipu while Caroline
        took a scenic flight from here over to Milford Sound and back (stopping for a cruise up the fjord because they
        messed up her booking!). <br/>
        <br/>
        Unfortunately they couldn't get a car to us there for another few days and instead offered to fly us to
        Christchurch to collect one, so we hopped on a flight that evening enjoying nice views out over the Southern
        Alps along the way. We collected another white automatic stationwagon in Christchurch then drove back over to
        the west coast via Arthur's Pass.<br/>
        <br/>
        Getting back on track our next stop was the glaciers of Fox and Franz Josef. Before getting on to the glaciers,
        we took a walk to see the bottom of the Fox glacier and walked round Lake Matheson for spectacular views of
        Mounts Cook and Tasman (Mt Cook being the tallest in NZ). The next day we again split up, with Helen spending
        the day hiking up Franz Josef and Caroline taking a helicopter up on to Fox and hiking around up there for an
        afternoon. We both got in amongst the blue ice and saw loads of cool ice formations (crevasses, ice caves
        etc).<br/>
        <br/>
        We left there last night and have spent today journeying up the west coast. We stopped at Punakaiki to see the
        Pancake Rocks (layered limestone rock), blowholes and took a walk up the Pororari River to see more cool
        limestone landscapes.<br/>
        <br/>
        We are currently in Westport, about to go see some more seals and then the Buller Gorge, before making our way
        up towards Nelson and the Abel Tasman NP at the tip of the South Island.<br/>
