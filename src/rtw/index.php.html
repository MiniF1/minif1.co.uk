            The last sets of photos are back and will soon be up for all to see. The sharp ones amongst you may notice
            that the sequence jumps from the Colca Canyon to Cusco - unfortunately we lost the film containing the rest
            of Peru when our bag was stolen <img class="inline" src="../img/smilies/02.png" width="18" height="18"

            I think that about rounds off our Round the World trip. We've been back now over 1.5 months and are settling
            back into life, with memories of scuba diving, eating piranha, climbing mountains and speaking something
            closely...

            We are still awaiting the last four films which I sent off to be developed, so keep an eye out for those on
            here soon. In the meantime, look at the photos section for a pic of us at Heathrow (do you like the footie
            shirt?!).<br/>

            Expect an e-mail soon from us as well (if you are on the list) detailing our adventures during the last
            month or so of our trip (it's nearly written...). And please get in touch with us as we'd love to hear your
            news! <img class="inline" src="../img/smilies/18.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":hand:">

            Well folks, the trip is over. 10 months has passed since we left, can you believe it? We landed safely at
            Heathrow on friday morning after 13 hours on the plane from Rio, via Sao Paulo and have spent the weekend
            catching up on sleep!<br/>
            <br/>
            We will finish our reports on our last week or so through the Pantanal in Brazil and our fun at the footie
            in Rio in due course, and the last few films have been sent off to be developed so watch this space!

            So what have we been up since we last wrote - we started off with a rather long bus journey from Santa Cruz
            to the border town of Quijarro. Not too bad a journey - bus would only start if bump started but it kept
            going for the required 18 hours! We got drug searched on the way but fortunately they left the tourists
            pretty much alone and arrived safely at the border early morning to find out that the train we wanted to
            take had broken down en route! (Also chatted to a...

            We have now made it as far as Santa Cruz and have booked our ticket to Brasil, although everything seems to
            have doubled in price since we arrived here (a surprisingly westernised city!) - we are frantically
            calculating and recalculating to make sure we don't run out of cash!!<br/>
            <br/>
            Since we last wrote, we visited the Casa de la Moneda (old mint) in Potosi, ,supposedly Bolivia's best
            museum (a random collection of coins, religious art, ceramics, minerals...) before catching a bus to Sucre
            (the capital of Bolivia, as we kept being told not to forget!). We spent a day here wandering...
