        We managed to kill more time in Resistencia by going out for a big dinner in a snooker hall, unfortunately
        although we got to the bus station in plenty of time our bus was late - not our day!<br/>
        <br/>
        The next stop was Tucuman in NW Argentina where we visited a few museums (half teh ones we tried were closed for
        renovation) so we gave up and spent the evening watching a film in our Hotel (we had to make use of the TV while
        we had it!).<br/>
        <br/>
        Next day we caught a bus to Salta where we visited a museum and art gallery and a few churchs which were very
        ornate and covered in Gold! We decided it was about time we had the traditional Argentinian meal called Parilla
        - basically a huge mixed grill which went down nicely with a jug of red wine!<br/>
        <br/>
        This morning we took the Teleferica up a hill overlooking Salta, there were huge groups of church goers up there
        making some sort of Pilgrimage! We headed off down the hill before they kicked off their celebration and caught
        a bus to Jujuy where we will spend the rest of the day wandering around seeing more churches and Plazas.
