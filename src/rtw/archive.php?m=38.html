        After a night spent on the floor of Bangkok airport we arrived in Hong Kong last thursday. It's almost as much
        of a culture shock arriving here from Nepal as it was arriving in India - it's so civilised! And expensive to
        boot... We finally feel like travellers as we are staying in a hostel as opposed to a hotel, which has the
        benefit of a good location, a kitchen and lots of other travellers to talk to (and steal guide books
        from!).<br/>
        <br/>
        We are only here for 6 days, but have managed to do quite a lot in a short time. So far we have visited the Peak
        with spectacular views over the skyscrapers and the harbour, walked round lots of street markets including
        birds, fish, flowers, clothes & handicrafts, had a boat tour round Aberdeen (no, not in Scotland) harbour and
        peered through the windows of lots of expensive shops! In terms of food we seem to be surviving by pointing at
        pictures to order, as the squiggly writing means absolutely nothing to us!<br/>
        <br/>
        China is our next stop, so we look forward to reporting on that soon.
