        <div class="messageTitle">Rotorua - Kaikoura</div>
        We have switched islands now (the views from the ferry last night were pretty nice, although there's a lot of
        low cloud around at the moment) and are in the seaside town of Kaikoura, famous for its dolphins, whales and
        seals.<br/>
        <br/>
        We had great fun at our Maori 'hangi' in Rotorua after we e-mailed last time - the compere managed to pick the
        one non-english-speaking person to go up on stage to be 'welcomed' by a maori guy, which involved much shouting
        and staring - the poor guy didn't know what was going on! The next day we visited the Museum of Rotorua (in an
        old baths building) and the Blue Baths (old thermal swimming pool) before heading off towards Taupo. On the way
        we went swimming in the geothermally heated Kerosene Creek (warmer than a hot bath!), walked round Craters of
        the Moon (a field with lots of steaming craters & mudpools), watched the sluice gates being opened on the
        Aratiatia Dam to flood some rapids (purely a show for the tourists!) and visited Huka Falls before reaching Lake
        Taupo (NZ's largest lake). On our journey out towards Napier that night we stopped to help a broken down car,
        which meant Helen negotiating a doberman & a bull mastiff (& a labrador) late at night to borrow a telephone to
        call the AA!<br/>
        <br/>
        Napier is famous for its Art Deco architecture, so we did an historic walk around the city to admire it all. We
        also did a tannery tour to see sheepskins being turned into rugs & booties, and spent the afternoon on a 4x4 bus
        travelling o'er hill and down dale to a gannet colony. We spent 45 minutes up on the cliff within touching
        distance of these (rather large) birds trying to work out the difference between male & female!<br/>
        <br/>
        On the way between here & Wellington we stopped at Mount Bruce Wildlife Sanctuary spotting rare NZ birds (inc
        kiwis), ducks, eels, tuatara (lizards) and learning about their habitats.<br/>
        <br/>
        We stayed in the capital city for a day and a half, arriving saturday afternoon in time to visit the national
        museum (Te Papa). We then drove up Mount Victoria for nice views over the city and the bay, before hitting the
        pub to try more Kiwi beers and watch the rugby then going to the cinema to see the latest James Bond movie!
        Sunday we visited the Museum of Wellington City & Sea, took a tour of Parliament House, peered inside Old St
        Pauls cathedral and walked round the government district before getting the cable car up another hill and
        walking back down through the Botanic Gardens.<br/>
        <br/>
        Then we caught the ferry to Picton in the South Island which arrived late at night (but did not have any
        coverage of the Grand Prix, much to our disgust!). In making lunch yesterday Helen managed to cut her thumb so
        that she couldn't drive and could therefore take full advantage of the wine tastings this morning at the Montana
        winery! She hopes it gets better quickly as we have booked on a sea-kayaking tour tomorrow to visit the
        seals!<br/>
