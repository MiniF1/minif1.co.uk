        We are back from our Inca Trail all in one piece, with just a few aching muscles <img class="inline"
                                                                                              src="../img/smilies/01.png"
                                                                                              width="18" height="18"
                                                                                              alt=":-)"> We set off by
        bus from Cusco on saturday morning, stopping in Ollyantaytambo to be beseiged by locals selling everything you
        could possibly want for the trek (Caroline managed to procure herself a walking stick for 40p) before starting
        the trek at the imaginatively named 'km 82'. We walked for 2 hours before reaching our first Inca ruin
        (Patallacta), possibly a gateway to Machu Picchu. Then it was up the valley to Wayllabamba for our first
        campsite.<br/>
        <br/>
        The second day was the hardest trekking-wise - uphill all the way, over the 1st pass (4200m) then down to our
        second campsite. The third day was the most spectacular, with lots of ruins, lovely views and lots of nice wild
        flowers and hummingbirds along the way.<br/>
        <br/>
        The fourth day we had to get up early (4am) to make it to Machu Picchu (Old Mountain) for sunrise (well we were
        supposed to stop at the Sun Gate but two of our group were being difficult and disappeared off so we had to
        follow them). The best view of Machu Picchu was from the Sun Gate, where you really appreciated the sheer size
        and unlikely location of it.<br/>
        <br/>
        We spent the day being guided round the ruins, then Helen climbed Waynapicchu (Young Mountain) for superb views
        of the surrounding mountains and valleys while Caroline explored the ruins further.<br/>
        <br/>
        Had a great time with a nice group of people - 2 Belgian girls, a Japanese guy and 2 Aussie girls - and great
        food throughout. We stayed overnight in Aguas Calientes (town down in the valley) and got the train/bus back to
        Cusco early this morning.<br/>
        <br/>
        We have spent the day shopping to replace stuff we lost (we are now decked out in matching sunglasses) and
        chatting to people, including a guy we met on the boat down in Chile. It seems to be the start of some festival
        here at the moment, with loads of parades around the main plaza and a large food market selling 'Chiriuchi', a
        dish of guinea pig, chicken, pork, seaweed, caviar, veg. tortilla and corn - tasty <img class="inline"
