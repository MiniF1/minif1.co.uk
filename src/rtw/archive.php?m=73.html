        Since we last wrote we have headed North up to Nazca - home of the famous Nazca lines, geoglyphs dating back to
        before christ. We took a flight over the area so we could fully appreciate them! They come in all shapes
        andforms - trapezoidal, and a variety of animals (monkey, dog, hummingbird, spider....). There are many theories
        about them, them generally accepted one is that they form an astrological calender and where used in religious
        ceromonies to 'pray' for rain. <br/>
        <br/>
        The next stop was Ica where we looked round the impressive regional museum which detailed all the ancient
        cultures of the area. The rest of the time was spent wandering around the standard collection of churches,
        markets etc We got to within 20m of our hotel only to have our purse pinched, didn't loose much - just our
        student ID cards which is a bit of a pain, we are telling the sob story at all the museums so they let us in
        cheap still! We also went to the nearby Oasis of Huaca.... where we went sandboarding which is brill fun but
        exhausting climbing up the dunes the whole time! (Think we have finally got rid of the sand).<br/>
        <br/>
        Hit the coast at Pisco where we took a tour to the Islands of Ballastra to see all the wildlife that inhabit
        these islands - cormorants (3 types), peruvian boobies, humbolt penguins, 'smart' terns and of course seals. So
        many birds live here that they harvest the Guano to use as a fertilizer! Had a lovely meal out in the evening
        complete with the local drink of Pisco sour (pisco with lime and egg white).<br/>
        <br/>
        Then headed up to the capital where we are staying in a hostel in a huge colonial building right near the
        center. So far we have visited the national museum which took hours to see everything, the fortress of Real
        Felipe (biggest in S. Am apparently) and wandered around getting a feal for the place! Someone tried to steal
        Carolines watch the other day but she fought him off well! There is so much to do here that we will be around
        for a few more days.
