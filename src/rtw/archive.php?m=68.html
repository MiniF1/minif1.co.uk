        We?re back in Chile again now, having done Bolivia briefly for the time being. We spent 4 days in a Jeep
        travelling across the famous salt flats (3 days there, 1 night back!), seeing loads of cool stuff including
        lakes of varying colours, flamingoes (James and Chilean varieties), rocks (Salvador Dali style), coloured
        mountains, volcanoes (some active), the highest geyser field in the world (we bathed in a nearby hot lake) - all
        this at between 3800 and 4900masl which meant that despite the fact it was desert it was bloomin' cold! (it got
        down to -15 deg the first night - Caroline was very glad she bought a sleeping bag!)<br/>
        <br/>
        We spent a few hours in Uyuni in Bolivia before deciding that we were going to do north Chile if it killed us,
        so booked on a Jeep back to San Pedro. From here we caught a bus to Calama, from where we visited the nearby
        town of Chuquicamata, home of the world?s largest open pit copper mine (4.3km long, 3km wide, 850m deep). Then
        we caught a bus to the rather english port of Antofagasta where we are now. They even have a replica of Big Ben
        in their main plaza, and red telephone boxes in the old station! We are planning to head up the coast to Iquique
        soon, then on to Arica and hopefully into Peru - assuming the transport strikes have finished!
