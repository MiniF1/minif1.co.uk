        Just to let you know that we are well and have managed to leave Peru with the rest of our belongings intact but
        minus a substantial amount of Dollars to get Caroline across the border (she didn't have a Peruvian entry stamp
        in the new passport!).<br/>
        <br/>
        We really enjoyed the jungle despite the mosquitos an dHelen being ill (just a 24hr thing) and saw monkeys
        (loads squirrel, black and white and tamarin), giant otters (1.8m!), tiny bats (they looked like paintings on
        trees until they scarpered), turtles, a caimen, a giant spider (under Helen's bed!) and loads of birds! Was all
        rather luxurious staying in a lodge on the riverfront boating it everywhere and being cooked for.<br/>
        <br/>
        Back in Cusco we picked up Carolines new passport and did a little sightseeing before jumping on an overnight
        bus to Puno. Arriving 4am we stayed on the bus till teh sun came up then found some accomodation and jumped on a
        boat out into Lake Titicaca. We visited Uros (islands made out of reeds that float, everything on them is also
        made of reeds!) and Taquile wher we saw a tradional folk dance in honour of the winter solstice and explored the
        island. Sunset on the way back was spectacular!<br/>
        <br/>
        Into Bolivia, we arrived at the small town of Copacabana, gateway to Isla del Sol, supposed birthplace of the
        Inca. We caught a boat out to the island for the afternoon, had a wander round, decided it was too touristy and
        came back to Copacabana. We spent the evening watching the sun set over the lake from the top of a hill, then
        visited the cathedral (rather large considering the size of the town!) where we saw a very important Virgin and
        the Shrine of the Candles. The locals were celebrating the festival of San Juan with lots of fireworks and
        bonfires, which reminded us of Bonfire Night.<br/>
        <br/>
        The next day we decided to walk along the peninsula towards Yampupata, hoping to catch the bus back.
        Unfortunately there weren't enough passengers to run the bus that day, so we ended up walking back as well! The
        scenery was lovely though, little fishing villages dotted along the bays.<br/>
        <br/>
        Then we had fun trying to catch the bus to La Paz. Due to some blocades (we think it was the miners) most of the
        buses weren't running, but we managed to find one who reckoned he knew a detour. And it was a real detour -
        through farmers's fields, over rivers and down bike tracks until we finally rejoined the main road!<br/>
        <br/>
        Spent 2 days in La Paz, visiting lots of museums, markets and of course the obligatory churches. We actually
        learnt the most from the National Museum of Art where the guide even managed to stir an interest in Caroline for
        the religious art! It was quite a sociable stay as we went for dinner twice with people we met on the bus from
        Copacabana, plus people they had met on the Inca Trail.<br/>
        <br/>
        Next stop was Cochabamba where Kate (who we ran into on the island of Tacquile in Lake Titkaka) suggested we
        visit Toro Toro National Park. We spent a day in Cochabamba first, visiting anything that was open (we arrived
        at 6am!) including churches, convents and the Museo Archaelogico. We managed to sort out a tour to the national
        park and spent 3 days in a lovely hostal being looked after by our new surrogate grandma! The attractions of the
        park, apart from its lovely scenery, included dinosaur footprints, fossils, cave paintings, a large canyon with
        nice waterfalls and a large cave which we explored on hands and knees! <br/>
        <br/>
        The drive back to Cochabamba took longer than expected, so we missed the buses to Potosi we had planned on, but
        with a series of buses we finally made it here this morning. We have been to visit the famous mines which
        provides a lot of employment for the town, and which involved more scrabbling around on hands and knees to visit
        the miners at work (in pretty horrific conditions).<br/>
