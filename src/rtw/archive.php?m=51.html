        We are now in Cairns, having travelled up from Alice, across, up a bit more then down (only about 2000km in a
        week - not much!). To give a bit more detail, we drove up to Tennant Creek where we did a tour of an underground
        gold mine, then turned east at the Three Ways (deciding that Darwin was a bit far and a bit wet - 4-6 inches of
        rain a day!) arriving in Charters Towers in time to celebrate Australia Day at the local pub. <br/>
        <br/>
        We spent the following morning in CT doing a tour of a stamp battery (the place they get the gold out of the
        rock), before heading north via a national park or two to Mossman. Here we stopped for lunch and a walk through
        the tropical rainforest at Mossman Gorge, then drove up via the pretty little village of Daintree (the crocs
        were hiding from us in the river) and into Daintree National Park via the river ferry. We spent the night here,
        and visited several informative boardwalks through the rainforest and mangroves, a bat house (where Eggy the
        14-week-old bat decided Anna would make a good toilet!) and a canopy tower (23m high, showing views of the
        rainforest at different levels) the next day.<br/>
        <br/>
        On the way down to Cairns from the NP we stopped for the night by the beach at Port Douglas and had a nice early
        morning swim there this morning (avoiding the stinging jellyfish & crocs). Now in Cairns we have all booked on
        diving courses for the next few days - Anna is doing her Open Water course, and we are doing our Advanced Open
        Water which involves 3 days & 2 nights out on the reef in a boat! Can't wait <img class="inline"
