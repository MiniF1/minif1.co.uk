        Sorry we haven't been in touch for a while, but internet in Malaysia was expensive (relatively speaking) and
        we've been tight on time getting down to Singapore for Christmas - the transport system seemed to be against us
        the whole time!<br/>
        <br/>
        But we arrived safely in Singapore this afternoon (cutting it a bit fine!) and found a hostel for the night.
        Since we last wrote (Ko Tao, Thailand?) we have become qualified scuba divers (Great Barrier Reef here we come),
        got the night ferry back to the mainland (8 hours), jumped on a bus to Hat Yai, then another bus to the
        Malaysian border, crossed the Friendship Bridge and jumped on yet another bus to Kota Bharu. Phew! We stayed in
        Kota Bharu for a day, and saw a sultan's palace, a handicraft market, then ran into the sultan himself at a
        performance in the main square! Next we headed down to the Taman Negara (National Park - tropical rainforest) in
        the middle of peninsular Malaysia (it took 3 attempts to get on a train out though, and we lost a day through
        this). We spent a day trekking through the jungle again, being attacked by leeches and just missing going on the
        Canopy Walkway (supposedly shut at 12pm, but when we arrived at 11.45am they were walking off having just locked
        it up!), but we saw a 2ft long monitor lizard in the afternoon plus some wild boars, so we felt better <img
            class="inline" src="../img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"> Then we spent a night on the
        train down to Kuala Lumpur where we spent 2 days sightseeing (including the seeing the Petronas Towers from the
        Menara KL - a communications tower nearly as high). Unfortunately Helen wasn't feeling too hot (actually far too
        hot - fever) but the antiobiotics are kicking in now. After a day in the port town of Melaka yesterday (where
        the Christmas Spirit was abounding in the Portuguese Settlement) we got the bus to Singapore this morning and
        haven't done much since arriving.
