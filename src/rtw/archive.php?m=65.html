        We are now in a lovely place called Resistencia - well it was lovely last night when we arrived, but all our
        plans for today have been foiled as it appears to be a regional holiday (each county has its own day off) and
        therefore EVERYTHING is closed!<br/>
        <br/>
        Anyway, what have we been up to? Since Posadas we have been to Corrientes, Mercedes, Esteros del Ibera, Mercedes
        and Corrientes again and then Resistencia. Corrientes was on the rather large Rio Parana and had some nice
        churches and a nice 100m long mural detailing the town's history. We hit there on polling day for the national
        presidential elections so everyone was milling about the schools etc and drinking mate (local tea-like drink
        that all Argentians drink religiously).<br/>
        <br/>
        Despite being geographically close to the national park we had to take a roundabout route to get there via
        Mercedes. This was a sleepy little country town full of gauchos in their silly hats and trousers with not a
        whole lot to do. Unfortunately due to the times of the buses we were stuck here for 2 mornings either side of
        our visit to the park.<br/>
        <br/>
        Esteros del Ibera national park is a huge area of marsh/wetland and lakes which is home to hundreds of species
        of birds plus some cool animals. We spent a day and a half here doing a boat tour around the marshes and a horse
        trek. We saw caimen (small cousins of crocodiles), capybaras (overgrown guinea pigs), marshland deer, monkeys
        and birds of varying sizes and colours. We also met a nice group of Argentinians who tried to teach us Spanish
        using Scrabble letters and lots of miming!<br/>
        <br/>
        Unfortunately the only bus out is a 4am so we were up early for the ride back to Mercedes. We spent yesterday
        bus hopping to get from Mercedes, via Corrientes, to Resistencia and arrived yesterday evening. Wanting to leave
        plenty to do today we visited two small museums last night (everything is open late here) and wandered round the
        town for a while.<br/>
        <br/>
        Today we have managed to pass 2 hours wandering around the ghost town and visiting a sculpture park and have to
        find something to do until our bus to Tucuman (NW Argentina) leaves late tonight!
