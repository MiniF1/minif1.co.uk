        We left Townsville and headed south to Airlie beach where we climbed up Mount (hill) Rooper trying to get good
        views of the Whitsunday islands - unfortunately the early morning cloud decided to close in and all we could
        make out were silhouettes! We did manage to see a few snakes and a large Cane toad on the way so it was worth
        it! In the afternoon Caroline met up with Mark at the lagoon for a quick dip and to find out how he was doing -
        broke and without a car (dumped it in Brisbane) but having great fun and making loads of friends. <br/>
        <br/>
        Risking the rain and windy roads we headed up into the hills for Eungella National Park - platypus spotting
        capitol of Aus. Having gatecrashed a guided night walk we spotted this nocturnal animal and then again the next
        morning when we explored the rainforest on our own. It was nice to see the rainforest in the right conditions -
        wet! (This was the driest Jan since records began) After an energetic morning we headed for the "low" area of
        the National park and Finch Hatton gorge to visit two nice waterfalls hidden in the rainforest, Arlauen falls
        and wheel of fire falls. <br/>
        <br/>
        Exhausted and having had enough of the drizzle we headed towards Rockhampton for the Olsen Capricorn caves. The
        next morning we took a tour round the limestone caves complete with thousands of bats and an underground
        cathedral (supposedly better acoustics than the Sydney Opera house!). Next stop Koorana Crocodile farm where we
        met loads of crocs from 2days to approx 80years old with varying temperaments, far too many of the males ate
        their girlfriends for our liking though!<br/>
        <br/>
        This morning we have visited Bundaberg Rum distillery for a tour of the factory and obviously took advantage of
        the free tasting session. You may be interested to know that their best selling product is Rum and Coke in a can
        hence their latest release - draught Rum and Coke! We tried all the varieties - normal (37%), liqueur, premixed
        with Ginger beer and other stuff as well as the draught. On the way to Hervey Bay we got stopped for a random
        breath test by the police and as they couldn't find a trace of alcohol in Helen we want our money back!<br/>
        <br/>
        Tomorrow we are heading off to Fraser Island for a day tour of the worlds largest sand island after which we
        will carry on south.
