        We left Buenos Aires on a bus bound for Puerto Iguazu (close to the border between Brazil, Paraguay and
        Argentina). The 18 hour journey passed relatively quick and uneventfully! Arrived early morning and headed
        straight for the waterfalls, we spent the whole day in the park looking at the waterfalls (275 in total) from
        every concievable angle! We couldn't get over how many butterflies there were and all brightly coloured! <br/>
        <br/>
        The next day we ventured into Brazil to see the falls from the one remaining angle! Having completely done the
        waterfalls we caught a bus to San Ignacio a bit further south on the Paraguay - Argentina border. Here we spent
        a day visiting some Jesuit ruins (who were they - like missionaries?), the evening we walked down to the river
        and looked across to Paraguay (what we could see of it as the sun set too early!). Went out to dinner for a very
        nice Pizza and then headed back to our lovely German Speaking hostel - confusing speaking lots of
        languages!<br/>
        <br/>
        Today we finally caught a bus to Posadas (after having waited 2.5hrs!) where we are spending the afternoon
        before catching another bus to Corrientes.
