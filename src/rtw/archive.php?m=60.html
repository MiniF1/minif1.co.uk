        <div class="messageTitle">Santiago - Puerto Montt</div>
        In Santiago we visited the Cerro San Cristobal - a 800m high hill in the middle of Santiago which we went up by
        Funicular Railway and walked down having visited the statue Santa Maria that watches over the city. The next
        stop was an art gallery which had special exhibitions on Damion Hirst (no dead animals though) and photography
        of India and Mexico (brought back lots of memories) plus chilian art through the ages. Having done our culture
        bit we headed for the central market for chicken & chips which together with icecream forms their staple diet!
        Next day we tried to visit a winery on the outskirts of the city but unfortunately teh bus driver didn?t tell us
        where to get off so we missed the guided tour and weren?t allowed round on our own (a pain as it had taken us
        over 2hours to get there)! We spent the afternoon visiting the highly recommended Museum of Pre-columbian art (a
        collection of inca and other tribal statues/relics) which was informative.<br/>
        <br/>
        Santiago done we got on a night bus to Puerto Varas (Lake District), we went for 4th class (lowest) which was
        still equivalent to teh service you get on an aeroplane - blankets, pillows, toilet entertainment and
        coffee&biscuits for breakfast! Having chosen the night bus to get nice scenery in the morning we awoke to thick
        fog obscuring the Andes, so bad we couldn?t even see the turning to the town once we were dropped off on the
        main road! a kind lady gve us a lift into the centre of town but we were too late for the bus to our intended
        destination (Cochamo) so spent the morning exploring the germanic lakeside town waiting for the fog to lift.
        After lunch we got a bus to Petrohue, a tiny settlement on a different lake, where we stayed in a small
        farmhouse across the river (by boat). We spent the afternoon walking up the hills behind the farmhouse to get
        nice views of Volcano Osorno and the evening learning Spanish from a chilian camper and enjoying a traditional
        Salmon meal. The next day we headed up the volcano itself following the lead of a very friendly alsatian
        labrador dog which gave lovely views of teh snowcapped Andes in the distance.<br/>
        <br/>
        Back in Puerto Varas that evening we relaxed in the hostel chatting to the other guests and drinking Pisco - the
        local fortified wine. Caught a bus to Puerto Montt this morning and have spent the day wandering round the town
        and watching the student games (downing competions and tug of war contests). The boat leaves tonight and we
        should arrive in Puerto Natales sometime on Thursday (hopefully!).<br/>
