        Thought we would write and say Hi from a rather wet Ushuaia - well they have been saying the weather was going
        to turn bad for ages and it held out for our walking!<br/>
        <br/>
        So what have we been up to? Mostly sitting on buses actually, firstly to Punta Arenas which we wandered round
        briefly looking at the very impressive graves in the cementry and mavelled at people in scarves eating
        ice-cream! We then had 13 hours on a bus/ferry to Ushuaia which claims to be the most southerly town in the
        world (ignoring Pt Williams 10km further south!).<br/>
        <br/>
        Ushuaia is a nice alpine feeling town and we have spent a lot of time just wandering up and down the main
        street! We also visited the end of Hwy 3 (most southerly Hwy) and the nearby National Park where we wandered the
        coastal trail and saw woodpeckers and foxes along with the standard amazing views. Today we visited the old
        prison where they weren?t worried about people escaping as they "would come back when they were cold or hungry
        enough"!<br/>
        <br/>
        Having had enough of bus journeys, in an hour we fly to Rio Gallegos from where we unfortunately have to get a
        bus to El Callafate! (only 4 hours though, easy peasy)
