        We have now made it as far as Santa Cruz and have booked our ticket to Brasil, although everything seems to have
        doubled in price since we arrived here (a surprisingly westernised city!) - we are frantically calculating and
        recalculating to make sure we don't run out of cash!!<br/>
        <br/>
        Since we last wrote, we visited the Casa de la Moneda (old mint) in Potosi, ,supposedly Bolivia's best museum (a
        random collection of coins, religious art, ceramics, minerals...) before catching a bus to Sucre (the capital of
        Bolivia, as we kept being told not to forget!). We spent a day here wandering around the pleasant city, visiting
        churches that were never open and a few museums (Casa de la Libertad where Bolivia signed its Declaration of
        Independence in 1825, an Indigenous Art museum all about local textiles and the garish 19th century house of a
        bolivian aristocrat). We also walked up a hill to a nice church and plaza with a view over the city.<br/>
        <br/>
        We then caught an overnight bus to Santa Cruz, but decided to pay a visit to Samaipata on the way, so got dumped
        on the main road at 5am! Sat and watched the sun come up while waiting for the town to awaken, then booked
        ourselves on a half day trek in Parque Nacional Amboro to see giant ferns and other woodland life. In the
        afternoon we visited the world's largest carved stone, a pre-Inca ritual site on top of a hill and after a quick
        visit to the museum to see how they think this site would have looked we caught a combi to Santa Cruz.<br/>
        <br/>
        Today we are going to see what sights Santa Cruz has to offer before catching our 18 hour bus (all the train
        tickets had sold out unfortunately) to Quijarro and the Brasilian border.<br/>
