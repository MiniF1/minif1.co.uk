        We've completed our tour of northern Thailand and are now back in Bangkok before heading down south to the
        beaches to do a diving course. This tour consisted of a short train journey to Ayutthaya (one-time capital of
        Thailand during the Khmer ownership of the country along with Cambodia) where we spent the afternoon looking
        round a variety of wats (temples/monasteries) in various states of repair and talking to a very nice monk. <br/>
        <br/>
        That evening we arrived in Pak Chong, near Khao Yai National Park, and ended up in a hotel with a swimming pool
        sharing a room with the staff as they were full! The next day we visited the park and trekked for 5 hours
        through the jungle to a couple of waterfalls (one of which was featured in the film 'The Beach'), seeing
        gibbons, squirrels, woodpeckers and loads of other stuff before doing a night safari and hitching back to the
        hotel. <br/>
        <br/>
        Then we caught a bus to Ban Phu (pronounced ban 'peugh', not 'poo' as we eventually discovered!), a sleepy
        little town in the middle of nowhere. From here we visited the Phu Phra Bat Historical Park to see lots of
        sandstone rocks on top of each other which were used by people in the 9th century onwards as temples and tombs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Then we had fun trying to work out how to get out of there - a series of three buses did the trick but we had to
        wait 2 hours for one of them adn finally arrived in Sang Khom as the sun was setting - so much for our bright
        idea of arriving somewhere in the light! As it is high season in Thailand we had trouble finding cheap
        accommodation but got the bargain of the century staying in an unfinished bungalow (missing a wall) overlooking
        the river for free! To make the most of our one day we decided a moped would be more effective than pedal power
        so hired ourselves a little red no. for the day and headed off along the river to see some waterfalls and Wats.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Moving on was again a challenge - us against the buses. A day with 6 hours waiting for buses brought us to
        Sukhothai at gone midnight where we woke up the hotel to get a room! Another day of exploring Wats completed our
        tour of Northern Thailand and from here we took the night train which brought us into Bangkok this morning. We
        have seen the two royal palaces to complete our sightseeing in Bangkok so we are now ready to head south.
