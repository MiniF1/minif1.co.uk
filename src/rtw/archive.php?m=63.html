        This must seem like a guessing game to you back home - where will we turn up next?! We are still in Argentina
        but we are now up in Buenos Aires, here is the story of how we got here!<br/>
        <br/>
        Since Ushuaia we have flown north to Rio Gallegos, mainland Argentina (1hour by plane as opposed to 2days by
        bus!) from where we caught a bus to El Calafate just accross the border from Torres del Paine NP. We spent 2
        days here bumping into people from the boat again and again, we can't escape them! The main attraction here is
        the mightily impressive Perito Moreno glacier which is 2km wide and 60m high at the face - huge when you are
        within a few 100feet of it! We spent a day seeing (and hearing) it from every conceivable angle and were most
        impressed with the huge chunks of ice which came crashing down into the lake with suprising regularity.
        Unfortunately they smashed on impact so no Titanic style icebergs - more like ice cubes!<br/>
        <br/>
        Our next stop was supposed to be Bariloche but we wimped out at teh 2day bus journey and flew 'straight' to
        Buenos Aires. Our flight turned out to go from Rio Gallegos to Rio Grande (200km south) then on up to Buenos
        Aires but 4 hours was alot better than the bus.<br/>
        <br/>
        Unfortunately the flight arrived late at night and we weren't too sure of the exact location of the hostel we
        had booked so after a little wandering and practising our spanish we found it and crashed for the night. We
        spent Easter Sunday visiting the San Telmo district with its antiques fair and Tango shows! After visiting
        church to catch the end of an Easter service we spent teh afternoon drinking sangria and watching a highly
        entertaining Tango show. We wandered back to town via lots of craft stalls to the main shopping street where we
        spent an hour in C&A (we thought it didn't exist anymore) trying on underwear - the women will understand <img
            class="inline" src="../img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)">! We walked as far as the bus
        station to book tickets to Puerto Iguazu (another 18hour journey) and headed home. <br/>
        <br/>
        Today we have visited the presidential museum, taken a tour of the opera house, walked round a number of park
        and gardens, visited Eva Peron's statue and grave, looked round a few cathedrals and generally got a feel for
        the place - it reminds Caroline of Paris!<br/>
        <br/>
        We are off to Iguazu tomorrow and will spent a few days visiting the falls before making our way back to Chile
        somehow.<br/>
