        Just to let you know we've made it safely back to dry land having gained our Advanced Open Water scuba diving
        certification. We spent a day in Cairns while Anna started her course, the morning on the beach and the
        afternoon looking round the Cairns museum and doing some shopping. <br/>
        <br/>
        On Saturday we left Anna in Cairns while we jumped on a very nice catamaran out to the Outer Barrier Reef
        (Norman & Saxon Reefs) for 2 dives before transferring to our liveaboard boat OceanQuest, permanently moored out
        on the reef. We spent 2 nights on this boat, diving 4 times a day (snorkelling in between), and Anna joined us
        on Sunday on the same boat. The diving was pretty cool - we saw sharks, turtles, rays, lionfish and a huge
        variety of fish & corals in a range of sizes and colours (including Wally, the Napolean Maori Wrasse who likes
        to be petted!). <br/>
        <br/>
        We went out for a quick drink with some of the crew back in Cairns before heading south for Townsville via a
        couple of nice waterfalls and swimming holes - one complete with a great rock slide! We're moving on again
        tonight after having spent the day visiting the aquarium here and doing some more shopping, hoping to avoid
        (ex)cyclone Benny on the way down!<br/>
