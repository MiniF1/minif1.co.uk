        <div class="messageTitle">Port Macquarie</div>
        We are now in Port Macquarie, speeding our way down the east coast. Since we last wrote, we spent a day on
        Fraser Island (largest sand island in the world) where we swam in a crystal clear creek and a rather green lake
        and saw a beached shipwreck (came adrift while being transported to Japan to be scrapped). Bounding around in a
        4x4 coach was a fun experience, especially as we each got a turn sitting at the front!<br/>
        <br/>
        Next stop was Tin Can Bay where we stood in the water to hand feed a dolphin called Mystique, before moving on
        to Noosa Heads for a brief stop on Sunshine Beach. That evening we arrived in Brisbane, where we spent the next
        two days sightseeing (City Hall, Botanic Gardens, Art Gallery, trip on CityCat ferry up the river, heritage
        walk, Mount Coot-tha, Maritime Museum and the obligatory shopping). Unfortunately we misread the parking
        restrictions and got a parking ticket one day, so we got the bus in the next day instead (with a very friendly
        cheery driver who was very helpful in giving us directions)! We made it to the cinema for the first time
        (something we promised ourselves we'd do for Christmas!) and saw Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers which
        finished at gone midnight.<br/>
        <br/>
        After Brisbane we carried on down the highway to the Gold Coast, stopping briefly at Surfers Paradise just to
        see how tacky it was - it was more tacky than we could ever have imagined! The beaches were backed by highrise
        hotels and appartments with shopping arcades underneath and a wealth of ice cream and surf shops! We moved on
        from here pretty quickly inland to Lamington National Park, where we saw pademelons (mini kangaroos), a large
        lace monitor lizard and a yellow-bellied glider asleep in the trees (looked like a tail-less possum at first
        sight!). Such a contrast to the Gold Coast, which we could see from the hills. On our way out of the NP we
        stopped at Natural Bridge, named after a waterfall tumbling down into a cave. That night we walked back to the
        cave to see hundreds of glowworms on the ceiling which was like looking up at the stars.<br/>
        <br/>
        Byron Bay was our next stop so Anna could do some more diving (we will get the chance to go again in New Zealand
        hopefully). We left her for half a day and headed to Mullumbimby for a market - the hippiest town we've ever
        seen! It must be stuck in the 1960's <img class="inline" src="../img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18"
                                                  alt=":-)"> After a quick paddle in the sea, trying to avoid the
        surfers and not get dragged along the beach by the strong current, we took a walk up to the lighthouse and the
        most easterly point of the Australian mainland which gave us gorgeous views back over the Bay and the mountains
        behind. We stopped for dinner next to the river at Grafton where we were amazed to see millions (literally) of
        bats flying out along the river to feed - a wonderful sight with the sunset in the background!<br/>
        <br/>
        Yesterday we stopped in Woolgoolga to visit a Sikh gurdwara on top of a hill on the way to Coffs Harbour. We
        made a beeline for the sunday market where we picked up some veg and a few souvenirs before heading to the river
        for a swim. After Coffs we pulled in to Nambucca Heads for a scenic lookout from the headland over the estuary
        before carrying on to Port Macquarie for fish 'n' chips. We are planning to head off soon for Nelson Bay and a
        coastal national park.
