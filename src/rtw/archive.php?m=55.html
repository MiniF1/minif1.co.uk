        <div class="messageTitle">Auckland - Rotorua</div>
        Have arrived safely in NZ and already seen loads. Spent a day looking round Auckland - climbing volcanos for
        good views, the normal museum as an intro to NZ and watched NZ lose the Americas Cup (sailing event) on a big
        screen in the harbour. <br/>
        <br/>
        After having looked into the price of coach tickets we decided we had got used to the independence of our own
        transport and have hired a stationwagon (estate car!) for the duration of our stay here. Went for the big car so
        we could sleep in it - although it's not as luxurious as the campervan we have kitted ourselves out nicely (home
        made curtains and a small camping stove seem to be doing the job)! Unfortunately the first one was broken so
        after 400km we got a replacement driven down to us, both are automatics but you can't have everything!<br/>
        <br/>
        From Auckland we drove through Kawakawa bay and Thames stopping in the Coromandel Forest Park for some scenic
        walks. We then went round the Coromandel Peninsula to Whitianga where we camped. Next day we visited Cook's
        beach and Shakespeare's Cliff before picking up our new car in Hahei then walking to Cathedral Cove (a giant
        arch eroded into the cliff) and stopping off at hotwater beach to build our own spa in the hot sand
        (ouch!).<br/>
        <br/>
        Today we stopped at the Maclaren Falls on the way to Rotorua, NZ famous geothermal area, we spent the afternoon
        looking at geysers and bubbling mud pools and learning about Maori culture. This evening we are going to a
        traditional Moari dance and feast to complete the experience.<br/>
        <br/>
        Have no definite plans for NZ yet although we have booked our Ferry between the Islands (Sun 9th out, Tues 25th
        back).<br/>
