        <div class="messageTitle">Adelaide to Alice Springs</div>
        We have now successfully made it halfway up the middle to Alice Springs, through some very undesert-like weather
        (it's currently chucking it down and we've seen a number of thunder storms over the past week). Our last day in
        Adelaide was spent visiting Ayers House (residence of the businessman/politician after whom Ayers Rock was
        named). Then we left civilisation and entered The Outback, first stop Coober Pedy, with temperatures of 48
        degrees C during the day followed by the most spectacular lightning storm they've seen for years! This opal
        mining town is built mostly underground where it stays a constant 24 degrees all year round (phew!) - we visited
        an old mine and an underground house. <br/>
        <br/>
        We then moved further north into the slightly more vegetated desert that surrounds Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Kata
        Tjuta (The Olgas), spotting emus and cows on the way and 5-carriage long road trains (we expected them to be
        bigger!). We got up early to climb Uluru (an hour earlier than necessary as they don't do Daylight Saving Time
        in the Northern Territory, which no-one had mentioned to us!) at sunrise, before the heat of the day which
        helped us appreciate the shear size of the rock and enjoy great views. As we had already walked round it the
        previous night we felt we'd done Uluru and moved on the The Olgas, 50km down the road. This is a rock formation
        eroded into 36 domes reaching 550m high, which we walked around. To complete the hat trick we then moved on to
        Kings Canyon, a large canyon with spectacularly eroded rocks and the 'Garden of Eden', a creek which somehow
        still contained water and was a haven for flora and fauna and swimming tourists! Although Uluru was pretty
        impressive, we think that the other two lesser known attractions were more amazing.<br/>
        <br/>
        Caroline liked the scenery so much she decided to treat herself to a short scenic helicopter flight over the
        George Gill range (90km long, of which the Kings Canyon is part), which was absolutely fantastic!!<br/>
        <br/>
        We are now in the bigger-than-expected-considering-the-location town of Alice Springs, where we have done some
        shopping, learnt about the Royal Flying Doctor Service and stocked up on food for the next expedition through
        the desert. We also managed to almost bring the Post Office to a grinding halt when trying to cash our Aussie
        Dollar travellers cheques ($800 worth), as their system kept turning $50 cheques into $20 ones!!<br/>
