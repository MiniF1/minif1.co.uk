        <div class="messageTitle">Colca Canyon</div>
        We are back safe and sound in Arequipa after our 4 days in the Colca Canyon. The first day was a bus tour into
        the canyon, stopping along the way to look at vicunas (related to the llama), llamas, interesting rock
        formations, volcanoes and piles of rocks (built for good luck!). At the highest point of the day (4910m) we came
        across the first snow we've had contact with for months, so we had to indulge in a snowball fight and Helen
        built a miniature snowman! We arrived in Chivay in time to enjoy our first taste of alpaca (another llama
        relation) for lunch - tasty!<br/>
        <br/>
        After a quick walk around the town (5000 inhabitants) we were taken 3 km down the road to the hot springs where
        water at 86 degrees is cooled down to 39 degrees for us tourists to bathe in! After a relaxing soak we went back
        to Chivay for an evening of folklore entertainment. This involved 5 guys on a stage playing music from all over
        latin america (think pan pipes, recorder-like instruments, guitars...) while 2 people danced some traditional
        dances (and looked particularly uninterested in doing so!).<br/>
        <br/>
        We had to be up for breakfast at 4.30am the next morning to catch a bus at 5am to Mirador (lookout) del Tapay
        where we sat for an hour watching condors soaring over the canyon before beginning our trek down the canyon
        side. It was just the two of us in our group, with Angel our guide. We took 3.5 hours to walk in zig zags down
        the 1400m to the Rio Colca at the bottom, where we took a rest in the shade and a quick dip in the river before
        carrying on up the other side of the canyon to San Juan de Chuccho. We had lunch here and spent the afternoon
        enjoying the few hours of sunlight before retiring to our hut at about 8.30pm for bed.<br/>
        <br/>
        The second day of trekking involved a climb up to the village of Tapay where we climbed the bell tower of the
        church for nice views of the canyon and terraces and lush vegetation. Then it was a scramble down again and
        along to a few more small villages and finally to "Oasis" where we spent the afternoon relaxing in/by the pool
        and chatting to lots of other tourists.<br/>
        <br/>
        The final day started with a wake-up knock at 2.45am, a cup of mate de coca and then we set off back up the hill
        by torch/moonlight. We made it up before the sun had properly risen, just in time to catch the 7am bus from
        Cabanaconde back to Chivay. Here we all piled into a taxi (by now we had befriended a group of 2 Danish girls
        and a Swiss German girl who talked too much) and went back to the hot springs to relax our aching muscles before
        the 4 hour bus ride back to Arequipa.<br/>
        <br/>
        We have spent today doing more sightseeing in Arequipa, visiting a convent with a museum (very busy as it was
        free for locals today!) and the posh district of Yanahuara. We catch the bus tonight to our next stop, Nazca.
