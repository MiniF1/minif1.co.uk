        Since we last wrote we have successfully crossed Cambodia, even if we did get locked in No Man's Land between
        Cambodia and Thailand! Details below. We left HCMC for the Mekong Delta where we spent a day cruising some
        islands in the delta near My Tho (Dragon, Unicorn, Phoenix & Turtle islands) where we tasted tropical fruits and
        had our own private performance of traditional Vietnamese music! The next day we took a boat up the river, via a
        fish farm and an old village, to the border and on to Phnom Penh. We spent 2 days sightseeing in Phnom Penh (saw
        the Royal Palace, Silver Pagoda, various temples & wats (buddhist monasteries), markets, 2 museums and the
        Killing Fields (site of mass graves from Pol Pot's genocidal regime in '75-'79)). We left Phnom Penh on
        Caroline's birthday bound for Siem Reap and the ancient capital of Angkor. After a very bumpy bus journey we
        arrived safe and sound, and spent the evening having a nice meal, accompanied by Lara Croft (did you know Tomb
        Raider was filmed in Cambodia?) and followed by ice cream. We hired a tuk tuk for 2 days to visit the temples at
        Angkor (built from the 9th-13th centuries, but left to the jungle until they were rediscovered last century),
        and saw a gorgeous sunset over the jungle. We then departed again by a very bumpy bus bound for Bangkok. This
        journey, which should have taken 9 hours, took 15 due to an overheating bus, bridge repairs and problems at the
        border (we arrived as it was closing, got stuck in No Man's Land and our guide made a run back to Cambodia with
        our bus tickets leaving us stranded and having to pay again for a minibus to take us to Bangkok). To make the
        day even worse, Caroline ended up being sick when we arrived! But we've had a good day in Bangkok seeing the
        sites, and Caroline ordered a tailor-made suit (shopping always improves one's state of mind!) and we're
        planning to jump on a bus tomorrow and head north.
