        Well having arrived safely in Sydney on the 28th, we've since met up with Anna and picked up the campervan that
        will be our home for the next two months!<br/>
        <br/>
        New Years Day we pottered around for the day before jumping in the campervan for the first leg of our Oz
        adventure and headed south for Canberra. Since arriving here we have stayed with Jacqui (a rafting/trekking
        friend from Nepal) and her mad house mate Kieren who have been acting as our tour guides. Yesterday we visited
        the Corin Forest, the site of the longest bobsled run in the southern hemisphere so of course we had to have a
        go! Then via a waterfall (a shadow of its former self due to the drought) to Tidbinbilla Nature reserve where we
        saw Koalas (yup they look really cute in real life!), emu's (which Kieren tried to ride) and kangaroos -
        complete with Joey's in their pouches. Then in true Aussie style we spent the evening with the extended family
        having a Barbie by the lake and trying loads of Aussie beers before heading back to Jacqui's and being educated
        in Aussie humour and watching the film Two Hands. <br/>
        <br/>
        Todays itinery has been touring round the city visiting Parliament House, the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, the
        Australian War Memorial and Lake Burley Griffin with a Carillon (bell tower) on an island. This evening we are
        being taken round the pubs/bars of Canberra before heading off to the Snowy mountains tomorrow.
