        Not a lot to report since our last message from Huaraz, as we have spent the last 4 days on buses! From Huaraz
        to La Union, to Huanuco (spent the afternoon), to Huancayo, to Ayacucho, to Andahuaylas and finally arrived in
        Cusco at 5am this morning! The scenery throughout was spectacular, far better than backtracking along the coast
        (the normal route). Apparently we also travelled the longest stretch of road above 4000m (150km long) - not
        quite sure when this was though!<br/>
        <br/>
        Unfortunately though on the last leg of the journey Caroline's bag went missing, presumed stolen, from under her
        seat on the bus. We lost quite a lot but we have spent the morning sorting out replacing things like her
        passport, cancelling cards and reporting it to the police etc. We think we've got everything sorted, and being
        as we are stuck here waiting for the replacement passport we have treated ourselves to an expensive week - 4
        days on the Inca Trail followed by flying into the jungle for 3 days!
