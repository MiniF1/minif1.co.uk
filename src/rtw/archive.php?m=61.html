        In the last week we have seen loads of beautiful scenery. The 4 day boat trip down from Puerto Montt was a nice
        way of seeing the fjords and channels around the south of Chile and luckily for us the weather held out so that
        we could see for miles to the snow-capped peaks of the Andes. We met loads of people on the boat and had great
        fun (bingo on the last night was particularly entertaining!).<br/>
        <br/>
        Since arriving in Puerto Natales on thursday afternoon we have spent 2 days in the Torres del Paine National
        Park. The first day we did a long day walk up to a lookout for the Blue Towers (after which the park is named) -
        if there's ever a Lord of the Rings: The Three Towers this is where it should be filmed! We stayed over night in
        a refugio (basic hut) and then met up with a minibus the next day which took us on a bus tour (japanese-style,
        with our cameras at the ready!) around the park where we saw 2 waterfalls, lots of nice views of the different
        peaks & glaciers within the park and icebergs (vivid blue) in Lago Grey from the Grey Glacier.<br/>
        <br/>
        Now we are waiting for the bus to Punta Arenas, even further south, from where we are hoping to jump on another
        bus tomorrow morning to take us to Ushuaia, the "southern-most city in the world" (except that Puerto Williams
        is further south!) for more nice scenery hopefully.
