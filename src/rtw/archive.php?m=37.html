        Two days into our stay in Nepal we booked ourselves on a 9-day white water rafting trip down the Sun Kosi (River
        of Gold - one of the top ten rivers in the world for rafting!!). Unfortunately, we booked this the evening
        before the trip left which didn't give us a lot of time to get organised! The trip was brilliant and gave us a
        good insight into rural Nepal. We made loads of good friends, including a bunch of Yanks, an Aussie, a Dane, a
        Mexican, a few Israelis and some lads from Northampton on the way.<br/>
        <br/>
        Determined to do some trekking in Nepal, after a long bus journey back to Kathmandu we then headed straight off
        to Pokhara. This is in the heart of the Annapurna mountain range and is where most people start their treks. Our
        small trek, known as the Ghorepani & Ghandruk circuit, lasted 4 days and reached a height of 3400m (to put this
        into perspective, Ben Nevis is 1343m!). The third morning involved a 5am start for the clamber up to the summit
        of Poon Hill where we saw the most amazing sunrise. We could see the entire Annapurna mountain range which
        contains some of the highest mountains in the world.<br/>
        <br/>
        We arrived back in Kathmandu 2 days ago and have finally managed to do the sightseeing that we keep getting
        distracted from, including a visit the temple complex known as Durbar Square. In a few hours we fly to Hong Kong
        (via Bangkok!) for the next leg of our adventure.
