        <div class="messageTitle">Westport - Auckland</div>
        Since Westport we have been to another seal colony, across NZ's longest swingbridge in Buller Gorge and then up
        to the most northerly point on South Island - Farewell Spit - home to many wetland species of birds although all
        we saw was black swans! We walked along the beach looking at more amazing limestone formations (caves, arches
        ...) as the sun set over the hills, unfortunately this meant we ended up cooking in the dark again!<br/>
        <br/>
        We then visited the much-hyped Abel Tasman National Park - where all the Kiwi's go on holiday! While there we
        went Sea Kayaking up the coast admiring the many golden beaches and watching the seals playing in the water. We
        stayed in the park overnight (7 in a bed) before walking the coastal track back to the car and driving on to
        Nelson. Not much here except a fairly modern cathedral (took them 30 years to decide on the design and actually
        build the thing!) and a little street full of the original cottages built by the first settlers, all nicely
        restored.<br/>
        <br/>
        From here it was a straightforward (well, quite wiggly actually) journey to Picton for the ferry (catamaran this
        time) back to the North Island. Having already done Wellington we whizzed straight on to Wanganui where we
        stopped briefly to ascend a hill from the inside in an elevator then on to Tongariro National Park. Everyone
        recommends the Tongariro Crossing, a 17km walk across a range of volcanoes with spectacular views -
        unfortunately when we did it the cloud descended and we could barely see each other let alone the views!<br/>
        <br/>
        Next stop on the journey north was Waitomo Caves, another much hyped attraction. We went on a caving adventure
        (called "Haggas Honking Holes") which involved 3 abseils, clambering through tight spaces, rock climbing and a
        lot of water - great fun! <br/>
        <br/>
        Then we bypassed Auckland and carried on up to the Bay of Islands where we stayed with friends of Caroline's
        dad's in their motel in Paihia. Our 3 days there were spent visiting Waitangi, where a treaty was signed by
        Mauri chiefs handing NZ over to the Queen in return for her protection in 1840, sailing around the islands and
        giving kneeboarding a try (waterskiing on a boogie board!), scuba diving to see the wreck of the Rainbow Warrior
        (Helen) and quad-biking (Caroline). We said goodbye to Andrew & Barbara (if you ever visit the Bay of Islands we
        totally recommend the Bali Hai motel!!!) and headed back to Auckland via the giant kauri forest on the west
        coast - they were HUGE!! (5m in diameter, 50m tall, 2000+ years old)<br/>
        <br/>
        We've handed the car back now (all in one piece this time!) and just have the Maritime Museum to visit here
        before packing our bags again ready to fly to South America tomorrow evening.<br/>
