        We finished off Lima by visiting the district of Pueblo Libre (twice) with its Anthropological Museum (more
        pots! and we thought this one might be different...) and the interesting Larco museum, full of more pots (55,000
        or so!) plus a collection of gold pieces and a famous Erotic Pottery display.<br/>
        <br/>
        Then we jumped on an overnight bus to Huaraz, up in the mountains of the Cordillera Blanca. We weren't planning
        to stay too long here, but were talked into doing some trekking in the surrounding hills. We spent 2 days in
        Huaraz chillling and organising our trip, then took off (in the back of a pickup with 6 bags, 3 dogs and a
        bike!) for 3 days camping and walking up some lovely valleys. The people who own the hostal we were staying in
        are building a lodge up there and let us camp on their land for free - it was very tranquil and watching the sun
        go down over the peaks was very colourful.<br/>
        <br/>
        We packed up camp yesterday afternoon and walked down to the nearest village to catch a combi (minibus thing) to
        take us back down to Huaraz - only to be told that we had to walk down to the next village. We found a combi,
        piled in with the family (of 9) we'd been following and spent the journey trying not to hit our heads on the
        roof while watching for the bag which we were convinced was going to come off the roof!<br/>
        <br/>
        Today we got up early to catch a bus to La Union, which we were told left at 8am. Unfortunately the 6 or so
        people we asked this morning all gave us different directions as to where the bus actually leaves from. In the
        end we booked on a 12.30pm bus instead, once we found the office! To pass the time we have visited the only
        street in Huaraz which has survived all the earthquakes and are going to visit a museum next (hopefully no more
        pots!).
