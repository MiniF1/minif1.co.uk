        Having done the north we headed down to Hue, the one-time capital of Vietnam. We hired bikes out again (somewhat
        more delapidated than the nice new mountain bikes in China!) and headed out into the countryside in search of
        the Royal Mausoleums. After a lot of asking directions we stumbled across them - a lot of work (3-11 years) had
        gone into the emperor-designed effectively graves. Next day we took a step back in time and visited the DMZ
        (De-militarised Zone), an area that divided North & South in the wars. During this trip, we felt our way through
        the Vinh Moc tunnels - a village moved underground to avoid the US bombing, complete with maternity room,
        kitchen & meeting room for 60 families (designed for people a lot shorter than us!) - then saw the remains of an
        American combat base, visited another minority hill tribe village and supposedly walked part of the Ho Chi Minh
        trails which brought supplies from the north to the guerrillas in the south (although it was now a nice tarmaced
        highway!).<br/>
        <br/>
        Another long journey brought us to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) where we have spent the last 2 days before we take
        a boat trip through the Mekong Delta and up the river to Cambodia. We have spent 2 weeks in Vietnam, longer than
        planned as there is so much to do and despite the weather (monsoon season is supposed to have passed!) it's a
        lovely country with very friendly people (in funny hats), cheap beer (20p a bottle) and cheap hairdressing
        facilities - we are now both sporting stylish (short) Asian hairstyles! We have sampled lots of the local
        cuisine, in particular the tropical fruits e.g. papaya, dragon fruit, some as-yet-unidentified bright orange
        fruit, sweet potato, as well as the more normal fruits such as watermelon, satsumas & apples - yum!<br/>
