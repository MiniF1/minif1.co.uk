            These things move slowly, don't they?
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            A few things to report on the house-buying process. I had a small hiccup with the mortgage, in that a
            technical problem meant that my application was received after the rates went up. However, my mortgage
            advisor is negotiating cashback to the value of the rate uplift because he says he applied for it before the
            rates went up, so fingers crossed that will work out.<br/>
            <br/>
            I have just received the results of the survey/valuation (I went for the basic one) which say that the house
            is worth what I'm offering to pay for it and that they don't see any reason why the mortgage lender
            shouldn't lend me the money for it. Which is good! :) The only things it did note was that the house had
            experienced some movement, but that there is no evidence to suggest this is ongoing, and that it has been
            subject to draininage alterations and repair, and suggests that I should check that all necessary
            permissions and consents were obtained (whatever that means?).<br/>
            <br/>
            My solicitors have also taken money off me to begin the searches, so I assume that's underway. And that's
            about all I have to report with regard to the house for the time being.<br/>
            <br/>
            What else has been going on... Dad ran a 12-car event for the CSMA West Middlesex car club on Friday night
            which went very well. Steven &amp; Uncle Michael were Course Opening Car while Mum &amp; I were Course
            Closing Car, which meant we had to keep stopping to pick up code boards and close the marshal controls
            (although most of them were already closed by the time we got there). Fortuntely the bar was still open when
            we got back to the Finish, although it was a close call!<br/>
            <br/>
            After clearing up and getting back to the parents' at about 1am, I then had to get up at 7am to drive back
            down to Southampton on Saturday morning, as we had a situation at work that needed to be resolved. Me? Going
            in to work on a Saturday morning? What is the world coming to! <br/>
            <br/>
            We finally finished at about 12.30pm, at which time I had to rush across to Portsmouth as I was entered in
            the Portsmouth &amp; Havant Badminton Tournament. I played with Nigel, and after some close games (and some
            not so close) we finished joint 4th in our group (out of 6).<br/>
            <br/>
            And as if I haven't played enough badminton recently, I filled in for Wildern's Southampton A team this
            afternoon but we lost 5-3 to Notorious. However, the result may be subject to change as we may be lodging a
            protest because one of the girls in the Notorious team played against us for another team earlier in the
            season (funnily enough in one of the other games I filled in for). But we're not sure what the league rules
            say on the matter.<br/>
            <br/>
            So that's me for the moment - work, buying a house, badminton &amp; ralying about covers it. If anything
            else exciting happens, I'll keep you posted!

                Sounds like the house-buying isn't going that badly - hoorah! I guess checking that all the necessary
                whatsits were obtained is so someone doesn't turn round after you've bought the house and ask you to
                take it all back up <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/03.png" width="18" height="18" alt=";-)"/><br/>

                Daniel's buying a place in London at the mo; something's stalling, can't remember what, but he's so
                nearly there!<br/>
                <br/>
                I'll stick to renting for now!
