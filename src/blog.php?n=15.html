            Friday, 12th November
            ||
            BT grrrr
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Am I being unreasonable in thinking that having to wait 2 months for a phone line to be connected at my new
            flat is on the far side of ridiculous??! January 10th is the earliest date they can give me. I mean, come on
            now fellas, it can't be that difficult. Are all the engineers taking the entire month of December off as
            holiday or something?<br/>
            <br/>
            Well, as you might have guessed, we've moved in to our new flat in Southampton. It's probably about 400
            yards down the road from our old flat, but it's quieter, bigger and brand new, so I'm not complaining. Our
            old landlord is selling our old flat, so we had to get out, but I think we've done quite well out of it.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I'm certainly not planning on moving again any time soon though - 2 days it took us to get everything out,
            furniture 'n' all, and move it 400 yards down the road (and that's not including the 5 or so trips Kerry did
            during the week). And that was with a fair bit of help, too! I'm sure when I moved down to Southampton 8
            months ago I managed to fit everything I needed into my Saxo. Well this time, my little Saxo probably did at
            least 10 trips backwards and forwards, and probably used up almost the same amount of petrol as driving once
            down from Heathrow would have done!<br/>
            <br/>
            But we're settling in nicely now. The heaters are working, (they weren't for the first few days, which in
            November is a bit of a problem!), there are lights by the front door (we couldn't see to get the keys in the
            lock at the beginning!) and the washing machine and dining room table are arriving tomorrow. It's starting
            to look quite homely now <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18"
                                          alt=":-)"/><br/>
            <br/>
            The only problem is the lack of a phone, and therefore also Internet. How can I possibly cope? So don't
            expect too many blog entries over the next TWO MONTHS (two months! I still can't believe it - that's a third
            of our tenancy agreement without a phone!), as blogging is probably not high on my list of priorities when
            I've got to stay late at work to do everything I need to on the 'net. Grrr <img class="inline"
                                                                                            src="img/smilies/10.png"
                                                                                            width="18" height="18"
                                                                                            alt=":angry:"/><br/>
            <br/>
            Talking of which, I'm going home now. I've done enough late nights at work this week, and being as it's
            already 6.15pm on a Friday evening and I have to get home and digest dinner before playing badminton, I'm
            going to say adios amigos!<br/>
            <br/>
            Hasta the next time <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/18.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":hand:"/>
