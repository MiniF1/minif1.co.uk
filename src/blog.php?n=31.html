            I just realised I haven't written anything on here for a while, as I've been so caught up with the house!
            Things are coming along nicely. I've got this week off work, so Dad has been helping me attack the first
            room. Monday saw us strip the wallpaper and polyfilla a few holes, plus we mowed the wilderness and turned
            it into something resembling a lawn (a very yellow and strawlike lawn, but it's getting there!). Yesterday I
            sanded the polyfilla down, and today Dad was back again to help hang the wallpaper. We've managed to get the
            whole room done, it's looking bigger and brighter already! Phase 3 is on Friday, when Mum, Grandma and
            Siobhan are coming down to help me paint the room and also do some more on the garden (which will hopefully
            include doing something drastic with the eucalytpus tree which is growing far too fast and threatening to
            take over). Not bad for a week methinks!<br/>
            <br/>
            I now have a bed, a single one which was kindly donated to me by Yvette from badminton (between her and
            Barrie I have gained a lot of stuff, I think their houses must be pretty empty!) so I'm sleeping in relative
            comfort. I'm still missing a sofa, but it's difficult to find one I like that's small enough to fit in the
            bay window. But with Marion &amp; Neil's kind houswarming present (4 folding garden chairs), at least I have
            seating capability now! It's all coming together...<br/>
            <br/>
            Thanks to all those who came to the housewarming party, it was lovely to see you all, even if I did spend
            most of the time giving guests the Grand Tour! Thanks also for the lovely e-mails and cards from those who
            couldn't make it.
