        <p class="CV">
            I graduated with a first class honors degree in Information Technology, Business Management and Language
            (German & French) from the University of York in July 2002. I have since spent ten months traveling around
            the world visiting countries in Asia, Australasia and South America (see my <a href="rtw/index.html">Round
            the World Trip</a> pages). Having returned very recently, I am now seeking to start my career. My aim is to
            work for a company in which I can be part of an efficient, motivated and professional team that takes pride
            in positively contributing to the company.
        </p>
        <p class="CV">
            As part of my degree I spent a year working in the e-Business department of CGNU plc, London. During this
            time I proved myself as a conscientious, committed and motivated employee capable of working with projects
            that deliver a real, tangible benefit to the company. I am proficient in the use of technology in the
            workplace and can demonstrate strong problem solving and team working skills. I feel confident that my
            personal skills and my propensity to learn allow me to become a valued member of any organization.
