            Well, things may have improved slightly - I phoned BT yesterday who said that in fact an appointment hadn't
            been booked for me and that December 14th was the earliest they could possibly do, would that suit? What?
            Eh? What happened to January 10th!? So I snapped that one up, naturally! However, transferring the account
            into my name from Kerry's is a whole other board game, which I'm not even going to tackle now, as that'll
            confuse the hell out of them and I'll never get a phone line!<br/>
            <br/>
            It's amazing how disconnected you feel when you've got used to having wireless internet access at home: when
            it gets taken away and you don't have any way of accessing your e-mails except at work, and can't just pick
            up the laptop and check the tv guide, maybe do a bit of christmas shopping... you feel as if you've lost a
            limb or something. Bizarre. And slightly concerning.<br/>
            <br/>
            Due to this ongoing lack-of-connection issue, I have some pictures waiting to be published which I can't
            upload, including one of a snowman called Simon! Let me explain... I went away for the weekend last weekend
            with some uni mates to Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire (or is it Worcestershire?). We hired a small cottage
            for the weekend, complete with exposed beams and real log fire! It was ace <img class="inline"
                                                                                            src="img/smilies/01.png"
                                                                                            width="18" height="18"
                                                                                            alt=":-)"/> We went out for
            a walk on the Malvern hills on saturday and it started snowing! About 2 inches fell in about half an hour,
            so there we were, on top of a mountain which we'd climbed for the views and we could barely see each other.
            So obviously we built a snowman and had a snowball fight <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/04.png"
                                                                          width="18" height="18" alt=":-D"/> It was so
            much fun! Especially for Fiona, Helen's housemate from New Zealand, who really got a a taste of English life
            <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/21.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":cow:"/> <br/>
            <br/>
            Then we visited a Christmas Fayre in an old Priory, stopped at a 'local' pub for some grub (and found out
            that the landlord's daughter used to live just round the corner from my parents! Small world...), visited
            Upton-upon-Severn (which was looking quite flooded) and went back to the cottage as it got dark where we
            spent the evening playing board games. I actually won Trivial Pursuits! I don't think I've ever done that
            before! And Pictionary was sooo much fun... <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/03.png" width="18"
                                                             height="18" alt=";-)"/><br/>
            <br/>
            Sunday we visited Tewkesbury with it's Abbey and lovely olde-worldy streets, had lunch at a lovely old pub
            and then journeyed down some lovely country lanes to get to Broadway Tower. This is a bizarre construction
            on top of a hill, inhabited by William Morris many years ago, from which you can look out over 13 of
            England's finest counties (on a good day) - we saw about 3 counties, lots of sheep and a lovely sunset!<br/>
            <br/>
            So anyway, the pictures of this will be uploaded as soon as possible, probably along with any pictures from
            this weekend, which starts tonight with Mum &amp; I driving up to York from where Dad &amp; Steven are
            setting off early tomorrow on Day 1 of their 3 day Lombard Revival Rally expedition around the north of
            England. This is an event which has been organised to revive the 'spirit of the RAC rally' and harks back to
            bygone years of good old rallying (before the days of 4 wheel drive, traction control, stages which are over
            in a matter of minutes and which only happen during daylight hours). Mum &amp; I are marshalling on the
            rally, which goes from York to Scarborough, the Yorkshire Moors &amp; Dales, Carlisle, the Lakes, Chester
            and Wales, and finishes up in Cheltenham on Saturday evening. A total of 1400 miles in 3 days, in cars no
            bigger than 1.4 litres and at standard spec (except things which can be up-rated for safety reasons, e.g.
            brakes, suspension), and with no service crews. It should be great fun! And with people such as Gwyndaff
            Evans and Anthony Reid taking part, it should be a tough event. Good luck boys!<br/>
            <br/>
            Right, back to work I suppose...
