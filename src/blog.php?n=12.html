            The Meaning of Life
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            It's late on a friday night and I had a mostly fun night at badminton even if that was the worst I have
            played in while, and now I'm completely knackered! At least I haven't got to worry about driving to Wales
            tomorrow, thank goodness - what a shennanigans that is going to be, the CSMA are really going to take a
            knocking for it... Sorry, that's the Curtis Bennet weekend I am talking about (CSMA's main motorsport
            event), altough I won't go into detail, I've had too much of it recently. Good luck to those who are
            going.<br/>
            <br/>
            So instead I get to lie in (hooray!) and have a lazy weekend, meet up with Gemma, watch the GP on sunday and
            play a bit more badminton and hopefully work out who my team mates are. All good fun. Here's to lazy
            weekends!<br/>
            <br/>
            What is the meaning of life? 42? Who knows... Don't worry, I'm not going to get all depressed on you like
            some people do on their blogs (not this time at least). I'm on an upward swing on the pendulum of life at
            the moment I think. I had a bit of a low a couple of weeks ago, then had a reality check and realised life
            really isn't that bad! It's what you make of it that counts.<br/>
            <br/>
            I've actually got quite a lot going on at the moment. Anna's birthday on tuesday, Kerry's birthday next
            weekend, body shop parties, Liz's leaving do, autotests, badminton matches, hopefully a weekend away with
            Helen, Mark &amp; Anna (good chance for a reminisce (sp?) over a bottle of wine or three) - keeping busy,
            just the way I like it.<br/>
            <br/>
            In case you are wondering, no, there is no point to this post! I just thought I'd try and enter a bit more
            on my blog a bit more regularly, even though I don't really have a lot to say without getting really deep
            &amp; meaningful... So it's a ramble you're stuck with I'm afraid.<br/>
            <br/>
            I think I've added some more photos since I last blogged, some of the Wales Rally GB (not very many I'm
            afraid, I was busy marshalling and you're not really supposed to be taking snaps while on duty). And some of
            Durham, such a lovely city. And some of our race day at Castle Combe (that was wicked!!). Just need to add
            some comments to them now...<br/>
            <br/>
            Right, that's it, I'm off to bed. Night night one and all!
