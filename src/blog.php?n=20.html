            Season's Greetings!
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Merry Christmas and good will to all men (and women and children). My thoughts at this time are those who
            have friends or family involved in the South East Asian disaster. Of all the times for it to happen, during
            the Christmas period must be the worst of all. I hope that if you have heard nothing yet, the old saying 'no
            news is good news' may apply.<br/>
            <br/>
            So it's not long now until 2004 becomes past and 2005 becomes present. Here's hoping 2005 brings happier
            times for all of us. For my family &amp; I, 2004 has been a pretty hard year, one which I am sure I will
            remember for all the low points, including losing 2 dear grandparents, my brother being involved in a car
            crash, my housemate being involved in a boating accident, a colleague suffering two heart attacks, a friend
            being mugged in Vietnam on a moped and ending up in hospital, my aunt &amp; uncle separating... oh, and of
            course I can't forget the time when my boyfriend left me for another woman. An eventful year!<br/>
            <br/>
            However, this just makes me realise that I am very lucky, as I have 2 parents, a fantastic brother and lots
            of really good friends; plus I have recently moved to a lovely brand new flat, I have a nice car and a good
            job - what more could I ask for really? <br/>
            <br/>
            Well, having my grandparents back would be pretty cool but I guess their time was up, we can't live forever,
            and after all, we can't have everything we wish for!<br/>
            <br/>
            And all in all, this year hasn't been all bad. I mustn't forget that Steven graduated from university and
            has got himself a job (and two promotions already!), two dear friends have announced their engagements,
            three friends have made the jump and bought houses (how grown up!), I turned 25 (is that a highlight or a
            lowlight?), I have settled down in Southampton and made lots of new friends, the Hamble Hornets have taken
            off and are going strong (a football team made up from girls who worked on the marina)... and I could go on.<br/>
            <br/>
            So let's look on the bright side, remember the happy times and look forward to an exciting and prosperous
            new year - may 2005 bring hope and happinness to all who read this.<br/>
            <br/>
            ****MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR!!****
