            Unplugged
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Well, things may have improved slightly - I phoned BT yesterday who said that in fact an appointment hadn't
            been booked for me and that December 14th was the earliest they could possibly do, would that suit? What?
            Eh? What happened to January 10th!? So I snapped that one up, naturally! However, transferring the account
            into my name from Kerry's is a whole other board game, which I'm not even going to tackle now, as that'll
            confuse the hell out of them and I'll never get a phone line!<br/>
            <br/>
            It's amazing how disconnected you feel when you've got used to having wireless internet access at home: when
            it gets taken away and you don't have any way of accessing your e-mails except at work, and can't just pick
            up the laptop and check the tv guide, maybe do a bit of christmas shopping... you feel as if you've lost a
            limb or something. Bizarre. And slightly concerning.<br/>
            <br/>
            Due to this ongoing lack-of-connection issue, I have some pictures waiting to be published which I can't
            upload, including one of a snowman called Simon! Let me explain... I went away for the weekend last weekend
            with some uni mates to Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire (or is it Worcestershire?). We hired a small cottage
            for the weekend, complete with exposed beams and real log fire! It was ace <img class="inline"
                                                                                            src="img/smilies/01.png"
                                                                                            width="18" height="18"
                                                                                            alt=":-)"/> We went out for
            a walk on the Malvern hills on saturday and it started snowing! About 2 inches fell in about half an hour,
            so there we were, on top of a mountain which we'd climbed for the views and we could barely see each other.
            So obviously we built a snowman and had a snowball fight <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/04.png"
                                                                          width="18" height="18" alt=":-D"/> It was so
            much fun! Especially for Fiona, Helen's housemate from New Zealand, who really got a a taste of English life
            <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/21.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":cow:"/> <br/>
            <br/>
            Then we visited a Christmas Fayre in an old Priory, stopped at a 'local' pub for some grub (and found out
            that the landlord's daughter used to live just round the corner from my parents! Small world...), visited
            Upton-upon-Severn (which was looking quite flooded) and went back to the cottage as it got dark where we
            spent the evening playing board games. I actually won Trivial Pursuits! I don't think I've ever done that
            before! And Pictionary was sooo much fun... <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/03.png" width="18"
                                                             height="18" alt=";-)"/><br/>
            <br/>
            Sunday we visited Tewkesbury with it's Abbey and lovely olde-worldy streets, had lunch at a lovely old pub
            and then journeyed down some lovely country lanes to get to Broadway Tower. This is a bizarre construction
            on top of a hill, inhabited by William Morris many years ago, from which you can look out over 13 of
            England's finest counties (on a good day) - we saw about 3 counties, lots of sheep and a lovely sunset!<br/>
            <br/>
            So anyway, the pictures of this will be uploaded as soon as possible, probably along with any pictures from
            this weekend, which starts tonight with Mum &amp; I driving up to York from where Dad &amp; Steven are
            setting off early tomorrow on Day 1 of their 3 day Lombard Revival Rally expedition around the north of
            England. This is an event which has been organised to revive the 'spirit of the RAC rally' and harks back to
            bygone years of good old rallying (before the days of 4 wheel drive, traction control, stages which are over
            in a matter of minutes and which only happen during daylight hours). Mum &amp; I are marshalling on the
            rally, which goes from York to Scarborough, the Yorkshire Moors &amp; Dales, Carlisle, the Lakes, Chester
            and Wales, and finishes up in Cheltenham on Saturday evening. A total of 1400 miles in 3 days, in cars no
            bigger than 1.4 litres and at standard spec (except things which can be up-rated for safety reasons, e.g.
            brakes, suspension), and with no service crews. It should be great fun! And with people such as Gwyndaff
            Evans and Anthony Reid taking part, it should be a tough event. Good luck boys!<br/>
            <br/>
            Right, back to work I suppose...

            BT grrrr
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Am I being unreasonable in thinking that having to wait 2 months for a phone line to be connected at my new
            flat is on the far side of ridiculous??! January 10th is the earliest date they can give me. I mean, come on
            now fellas, it can't be that difficult. Are all the engineers taking the entire month of December off as
            holiday or something?<br/>
            <br/>
            Well, as you might have guessed, we've moved in to our new flat in Southampton. It's probably about 400
            yards down the road from our old flat, but it's quieter, bigger and brand new, so I'm not complaining. Our
            old landlord is selling our old flat, so we had to get out, but I think we've done quite well out of it.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I'm certainly not planning on moving again any time soon though - 2 days it took us to get everything out,
            furniture 'n' all, and move it 400 yards down the road (and that's not including the 5 or so trips Kerry did
            during the week). And that was with a fair bit of help, too! I'm sure when I moved down to Southampton 8
            months ago I managed to fit everything I needed into my Saxo. Well this time, my little Saxo probably did at
            least 10 trips backwards and forwards, and probably used up almost the same amount of petrol as driving once
            down from Heathrow would have done!<br/>
            <br/>
            But we're settling in nicely now. The heaters are working, (they weren't for the first few days, which in
            November is a bit of a problem!), there are lights by the front door (we couldn't see to get the keys in the
            lock at the beginning!) and the washing machine and dining room table are arriving tomorrow. It's starting
            to look quite homely now <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18"
                                          alt=":-)"/><br/>
            <br/>
            The only problem is the lack of a phone, and therefore also Internet. How can I possibly cope? So don't
            expect too many blog entries over the next TWO MONTHS (two months! I still can't believe it - that's a third
            of our tenancy agreement without a phone!), as blogging is probably not high on my list of priorities when
            I've got to stay late at work to do everything I need to on the 'net. Grrr <img class="inline"
                                                                                            src="img/smilies/10.png"
                                                                                            width="18" height="18"
                                                                                            alt=":angry:"/><br/>
            <br/>
            Talking of which, I'm going home now. I've done enough late nights at work this week, and being as it's
            already 6.15pm on a Friday evening and I have to get home and digest dinner before playing badminton, I'm
            going to say adios amigos!<br/>
            <br/>
            Hasta the next time <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/18.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":hand:"/>

            Bryan Rocks
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I saw Bryan Adams on Friday night at Wembley Arena with some old school friends and I think I can safely say
            a good sing song was had by all! (Piccies are up in the Photo Gallery - some are better than others.) I had
            forgotten just how many songs he has done, and how many good ones at that. Being as it was the 20th
            anniversary this month of the release of his Reckless album (blimey he's been going a while!), he played
            some good old songs, including Run to You, Kids Wanna Rock, as well as the old classics like Summer of '69,
            Everything I Do, 18 til I Die plus loads of other good tracks such as Cuts Like A Knife, Heaven, Cloud No 9
            and a couple of new ones. He is such a natural live performer, his voice sounds just like it does on the
            albums with no apparent effort and his guitar playing is out of this world (not that I'm an expert or
            anything) and judging by the audience he has a wide appeal. It's no wonder he's still going strong after 20
            years - the concert was a sell out, filled with all sorts, from grannies &amp; balding old men down to
            teenagers (some with their mums &amp; dads, others screaming girls down at the front!). A thoroughly good
            night's entertainment I feel.<br/>
            <br/>
            What else have I been up to... ah yes, the Hallowe'en party at Gemma &amp; Dan's in Bath last night. Top
            marks to Dan's uni friends and their costumes; special mention must go to Mr Pumpkinhead - although I'm not
            sure I would like to wear a cutout pumpkin with LED's in the eye holes on my head, he pulled it off very
            well! Thanks to Gemma &amp; Dan for their hospitality. I hope we didn't leave too much of a mess!<br/>
            <br/>
            The party also provided the opportunity to catch up with Heather, who I haven't seen for a while. There was
            a lot of DIY talk going on (my friends have all become experts in varying DIY areas, from fitting central
            heating systems, to gutting and refitting new bathrooms &amp; kitchens, to fixing windows and goodness knows
            what else!), with a particularly perplexing conversation about different types of skirting board. So,
            anyway, I'm really looking forward to moving into my brand new flat tomorrow, where no renovations are
            required just yet! They won't even let us install our own washing machine, they trust us that much <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"/> Which is perfectly fine by
            me...

            Back on form
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I played my first badminton match for Wildern BC tonight, against Chandlers Ford. Carlos &amp; I won 15-4,
            15-13, then Janet and I took our Ladies game 15-3, 15-6. I thought they said this league would be tough!! I
            don't think the opposition had their strongest team out to be fair, but still! <img class="inline"
                                                                                                src="img/smilies/04.png"
                                                                                                width="18" height="18"
                                                                                                alt=":-D"/><br/>
            <br/>
            It's a shame I can't make friday night's match, but then it's not every day you get the chance to see Bryan
            Adams live. Ok, so he's not the hippest of artists, and is getting on a bit, but I did grow up listening to
            him (that was the summer of '69!) and seeing anyone playing live is a treat - come on guys, surely it's
            better than Take That &amp; Boyzone, the only other concerts I've been to!<br/>
            <br/>
            Then I've got Gemma &amp; Dan's Hallowe'en/Engagement party to look forward to on Saturday which should be a
            good laugh! And rumour has it, Heather's going to be there - a rare treat! Especially to have all three of
            us girlies in the same place at the same time (first time since we left uni I think!). I can't wait <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"/><br/>
            <br/>
            And then I guess I'd better start thinking about packing... Kerry &amp; I have got a new flat, hoorah! Our
            current landlord decided he wanted to sell our place, so we (well, mostly Kerry) went hunting and stumbled
            across a brand new development of flats over the road, so we snapped up the 2-bed penthouse suite <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"/> It's not even finished yet!
            They do keep assuring us it'll be ready for the 1st, when we move in... I want to get a sofabed bed in it so
            you guys can all come and visit and have somewhere to stay. No excuses now!

            The Meaning of Life
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            It's late on a friday night and I had a mostly fun night at badminton even if that was the worst I have
            played in while, and now I'm completely knackered! At least I haven't got to worry about driving to Wales
            tomorrow, thank goodness - what a shennanigans that is going to be, the CSMA are really going to take a
            knocking for it... Sorry, that's the Curtis Bennet weekend I am talking about (CSMA's main motorsport
            event), altough I won't go into detail, I've had too much of it recently. Good luck to those who are
            going.<br/>
            <br/>
            So instead I get to lie in (hooray!) and have a lazy weekend, meet up with Gemma, watch the GP on sunday and
            play a bit more badminton and hopefully work out who my team mates are. All good fun. Here's to lazy
            weekends!<br/>
            <br/>
            What is the meaning of life? 42? Who knows... Don't worry, I'm not going to get all depressed on you like
            some people do on their blogs (not this time at least). I'm on an upward swing on the pendulum of life at
            the moment I think. I had a bit of a low a couple of weeks ago, then had a reality check and realised life
            really isn't that bad! It's what you make of it that counts.<br/>
            <br/>
            I've actually got quite a lot going on at the moment. Anna's birthday on tuesday, Kerry's birthday next
            weekend, body shop parties, Liz's leaving do, autotests, badminton matches, hopefully a weekend away with
            Helen, Mark &amp; Anna (good chance for a reminisce (sp?) over a bottle of wine or three) - keeping busy,
            just the way I like it.<br/>
            <br/>
            In case you are wondering, no, there is no point to this post! I just thought I'd try and enter a bit more
            on my blog a bit more regularly, even though I don't really have a lot to say without getting really deep
            &amp; meaningful... So it's a ramble you're stuck with I'm afraid.<br/>
            <br/>
            I think I've added some more photos since I last blogged, some of the Wales Rally GB (not very many I'm
            afraid, I was busy marshalling and you're not really supposed to be taking snaps while on duty). And some of
            Durham, such a lovely city. And some of our race day at Castle Combe (that was wicked!!). Just need to add
            some comments to them now...<br/>
            <br/>
            Right, that's it, I'm off to bed. Night night one and all!

            Busy busy busy
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Wow I have been busy recently. A weekend in London visiting lots of old friends I haven't seen for a while,
            traumas trying to replace the rear brakes on my car and a day driving my Dad's Porsche and my uncle's
            Renault Clio 172 around Castle Combe racing circuit. Then 4 days at work...<br/>
            <br/>
            Then Grandma's 80th birthday party, which to me was a reunion of cousins - the first time all 10 of us were
            in one place in quite a few years, which was a good opportunity to catch up. Then three days at work...<br/>
            <br/>
            Then last thursday I was off to Wales for the annual trip to the British round of the World Rally
            Championships (moved forward to September this year from November). This year though I was on my own, as so
            many of my fellow marshalls from the CSMA North London Marshall Team had boycotted the event for various
            reasons. Once I got past the traumas of thursday night and trying to find where I was supposed to be and the
            people I was working with, it all went smoothly. Friday was absolutely knackering but by far the best day,
            mingling with the co-drivers and organising everyone (I think I get my bossy streak from my Mum!). Saturday
            &amp; Sunday at Margam were a doddle after friday, then it was home and back to work...<br/>
            <br/>
            And what's in store this weekend? Hopefully a day trip to Chessington World of Adventures with Maz &amp; Liz
            from work. Blimey it's been a few years since I've been there, but it's always a good laugh!<br/>
            <br/>
            Ooh, and here's some exciting news - Gemma &amp; Dan are engaged! How excited am I! Even though we saw it
            coming for ages <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"/> They make
            such a lovely couple, I wish them both all the best.<br/>
            <br/>
            That's it from me for now. I really ought to get some more photos up here though didn't I. Ok, I'll work on
            it.

            Where have I been?
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            What do you think of this? This shows all the countries I have visited in my life - 29 in total, which is a
            measly 13% of the world. Plenty more to go! I'd better get a move on...<br/>

            Back online
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            A big thanks to Rick for helping me get MiniF1.co.uk back online after my hosting company liquidated and
            took my site with them! <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/09.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-o"/> Grr.<br/>
            <br/>
            This is just a quick message to say that if anything's missing or not as it was, please bear with us as we
            work to rebuild the site. Most of it is back in place, although I have lost some of the more recent blog
            &amp; guestbook entries (which I'm not going to attempt to recreate!), photos I have still got, so if
            they're not there they will be soon! <br/>
            <br/>
            Moral of the story: Take backups. Regularly. <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/10.png" width="18"

            Moved!
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Hello, Rick again. Just stopping the last message from being &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot;<br/>
            <br/>
            The old host has died, so I've moved the site across to another server. Things may be odd here till I get a
            chance to straighten things out. Dates and times for a start... Bear with us please! You may see a few
            &quot;Testing...&quot; things here and there, it should all be straight by Friday.<br/>
            <br/>
            I hope.
        </p>
