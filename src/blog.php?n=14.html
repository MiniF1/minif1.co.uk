            Bryan Rocks
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I saw Bryan Adams on Friday night at Wembley Arena with some old school friends and I think I can safely say
            a good sing song was had by all! (Piccies are up in the Photo Gallery - some are better than others.) I had
            forgotten just how many songs he has done, and how many good ones at that. Being as it was the 20th
            anniversary this month of the release of his Reckless album (blimey he's been going a while!), he played
            some good old songs, including Run to You, Kids Wanna Rock, as well as the old classics like Summer of '69,
            Everything I Do, 18 til I Die plus loads of other good tracks such as Cuts Like A Knife, Heaven, Cloud No 9
            and a couple of new ones. He is such a natural live performer, his voice sounds just like it does on the
            albums with no apparent effort and his guitar playing is out of this world (not that I'm an expert or
            anything) and judging by the audience he has a wide appeal. It's no wonder he's still going strong after 20
            years - the concert was a sell out, filled with all sorts, from grannies &amp; balding old men down to
            teenagers (some with their mums &amp; dads, others screaming girls down at the front!). A thoroughly good
            night's entertainment I feel.<br/>
            <br/>
            What else have I been up to... ah yes, the Hallowe'en party at Gemma &amp; Dan's in Bath last night. Top
            marks to Dan's uni friends and their costumes; special mention must go to Mr Pumpkinhead - although I'm not
            sure I would like to wear a cutout pumpkin with LED's in the eye holes on my head, he pulled it off very
            well! Thanks to Gemma &amp; Dan for their hospitality. I hope we didn't leave too much of a mess!<br/>
            <br/>
            The party also provided the opportunity to catch up with Heather, who I haven't seen for a while. There was
            a lot of DIY talk going on (my friends have all become experts in varying DIY areas, from fitting central
            heating systems, to gutting and refitting new bathrooms &amp; kitchens, to fixing windows and goodness knows
            what else!), with a particularly perplexing conversation about different types of skirting board. So,
            anyway, I'm really looking forward to moving into my brand new flat tomorrow, where no renovations are
            required just yet! They won't even let us install our own washing machine, they trust us that much <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"/> Which is perfectly fine by
            me...
