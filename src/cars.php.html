            My first car was this gorgeous little Fiesta:
            <br><br>
            I was given it to share with my brother when I was sixteen by my Great Auntie Peg, so that we could learn to
            drive in it. I passed my test first time in it and became the taxi driver for all my friends at school as I
            was the first to pass my driving test in my year.
        </p>
        <p class="right">
            And then, having had the Fiesta for four years I decided it was time to move on to something bigger, and
            more importantly, faster! So I bought an Astra from my uncle, who in turn had bought it from my parents.
            <br><br>
            ...But unfortunately, 3 months after I got the car it was stolen, joyridden and came off second best against
            a brick wall :o(
        </p>
        <p class="left">
            <img src="img/cars/fiesta.jpg">
            And so I brought the Fiesta out of the garage, got it back on the road and drove it for another year.
        </p>
        <p class="right">
            <img src="img/cars/saxoside.jpg">
            Then I decided it was time to move on again, and having saved hard from my year out I went out and found the
            perfect car, my new little baby (see left).
            <br><br>
            And now I have sold the Fiesta :o( but I am more than content with my new girl racer car, which is going to
            help me kick off my motorsport career!

            And finally, one day I want to own a car like this.
