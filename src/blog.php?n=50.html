            Badminton, badminton and more badminton

        <p class="newsBlurb">
            So the first of the Year of '98 SWPS girls is getting married! Rachel and Stuart will tie the knot on March
            10th, and to celebrate the happy event Rachel had a Hen Day yesterday. And a lovely affair it was too.
            Heart-shaped home-made scones with cream and jam to start, followed by some pampering (my nails are still a
            lovely shade of pink, thanks Karen!) then off into Richmond for dinner at Zizzi's, which was scrummy. A very
            civilised and fun affair, I hope Rachel enjoyed it as much as I did and well done to Jess &amp; Belle for
            organising!<br/>
            <br/>
            The only downside was having to get up early this morning to zoom back down south for a badminton match at
            11am, followed by a local tournament at 12pm (well we made it before 1pm, which was just abot acceptable!).
            We won the match 5-1 (Nigel &amp; I lost our 2nd mixed in 3, 17-21, 21-18, 19-21!). The tournament was fun,
            although I was definitely the weak link in my pair... I kept poaching shots off Steve then sticking them in
            the net. I couldn't help it! My racquet would appear out of nowhere, often when I was running away from the
            shuttle... Go gadget arm! But I enjoyed it, although I am knackered now, and contemplating tomorrow
            evening's match at Four Marks (1 court church hall - it could be a late night...).
