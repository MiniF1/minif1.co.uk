            Lombard Revival Rally
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Dad &amp; I did the Lombard Revival Rally last weekend, a 4 day endurance rally (<a
                href="http://www.minif1.co.uk/www.endurorally.com">www.endurorally.com</a>) for cars up to 1400cc. We
            started in York on Thursday, drove out to and stayed in Scarborough on Thursday night, then started bright
            and early on Friday for our first full day. This took us up through the Yorkshire Dales and Moors, via
            Kielder Forest (an old favourite of the original Lombard RAC Rally) to Carlisle where we stopped for 2
            nights. Day 3 was a loop up into Scotland and back, ready for a final stint down to Blackpool, finishing on
            Blackpool promenade on Sunday afternoon.<br/>
            <br/>
            <img src="pics/clio/rev06catterick.gif" alt=""><br/>
            <br/>
            After 2 selectifs and a navigational section on Thursday night, we were lying 32 out of 125 starters which
            wasn't bad considering I haven't done anything like this before. Leg 2 on Friday started well, and by the
            end of it I was finally getting to grips with the diagrams and text I was given to direct Dad through the
            selectifs. We cleaned the day and finished the leg in 19th position, which was bloomin' marvellous by my
            estimations!<br/>
            <br/>
            Leg 3 started early on Saturday as we were re-seeded based on the positions after Leg 1, and again we
            cleaned the day and finished in 20th position overall. Sunday saw us re-seeded again to 18th on the road,
            but this is where it all went wrong. A combination of fatigue and a stinking cold which meant I was losing
            my voice led me to call a chicane wrong on the first selectif of the day - we managed to stop, back up and
            get it right, but we lost at least 20s in doing so. We also somehow clipped a cone (we reckon we threw up a
            rock which knocked it over, we were no-where near!) which meant a 5s penalty so our clean run came to an
            end.<br/>
            <br/>
            That knocked our concentration a bit, and on the next selectif I didn't get all 7 letters from a code board,
            which incurred a 1 minute penalty. That threw me completely, and I lost my place in the stage and nearly
            missed a split which took us on a second lap of the stage. The next two stages saw us go the wrong side of a
            cone and go straight on into the grass over a crest as we saw the gap in the fence we were supposed to take
            on our right whizz past! At this point we knew we'd plummeted down the leaderboard (and more importantly
            friends who started the day 9s behind us had definitely leapfrogged us) so we were surprised to find out
            later that we got 18th fastest time on the penultimate selectif! The last test saw us navigate chicanes
            along Blackpool promenade, and in wanting to put on a show for the crowds Dad tried to handbrake it round
            the hairpin halfway along, but the concrete was far too grippy and we ended up facing the wall and stalling
            the engine! We stormed over the finish line to finish 4 days of gruelling rallying to see Mum waving her
            flag vigorously at the barrier, and half of Blackpool around her cheering us on! I was allowed to drive the
            car onto the finish ramp, where we had our photo taken before we could proceed to the hotel at the finish
            and finally collapse into bed. <br/>
            <br/>
            <img src="pics/clio/rev06finish.gif" alt=""><br/>
            <br/>
            To round the event off there was an awards dinner and presentation at the hotel on Sunday evening which we
            duly attended to congratulate fellow CSMA members on various awards (1st in Class 4 for Mike Biss &amp; Cath
            Woodman, Best Lady for Cath, a team award for the CSMA North West London crews...). We were clapping away
            merrily when they announced the winners of the Tony Fowkes award to the highest placed competitors on their
            first rally - and the award goes to.... Malcolm Grubb and Caroline Grubb! Oh my god! That's us! But Dad's
            done this before... ah well, there's not much we can do now, everyone's looking at us and clapping... we'd
            better dgo up! So we collect our trophies, have our photo taken again and sit down looking a bit bewildered!
            We weren't expecting that at all... <br/>
            <br/>
            <img src="pics/clio/rev06trophy.gif" alt=""><br/>
            <br/>
            Our final classification was 23rd overall, 11th in Class 3 (1301-1400cc cars prior to 2000) out of 85
            finishers in total. Which ain't bad really, even if I do say so myself <img class="inline"
                                                                                        src="img/smilies/03.png"
                                                                                        width="18" height="18"
                                                                                        alt=";-)"/><br/>
            <br/>
            So all that remains is to repair the exhaust on the Nova (it disappeared somewhere in a forest in Scotland)
            and for Dad to decide if he's going to sell it or keep it so Steven and I can enter the event next year. I'd
            better start saving...

                Saw you on the front page of the sump - your report makes for much better reading though! Well done,
                glad you got to do it :)

                Thanks, I enjoyed it even if it took me about two weeks to get my voice back! I'm working on persuading
                Steven to do it with me next year... Dad's offered us the use of the car, just got to find the money.
