            Safari pics

        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I'm back from my holiday, reluctantly, and coming down to earth again with a bump. It was a fantastic
            holiday, exceeded my hopes and expectations and I'm now working out if I can afford to go again next
            year!<br/>
            <br/>
            For those who are interested in the photos, the highlights can be found in the following two albums:<br/>

            African Safari
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I'm halfway through my African Adventure, currently in a rather posh hotel in Arusha waiting for a bus to
            take me to Moshi, a town at the base of Kilimanjaro. I've spent the last week on Safari, from Nairobi to
            Kisii, across the border into Tanzania to Lake Victoria, through the Serengeti via Olduvai (or Oldupai to
            the locals) gorge to the Ngorongoro crater and then to Snake Park just outside Arusha.<br/>
            <br/>
            It's been amazing, seeing elephants, giraffe, antelope, lions, cheetah, wildebeest, baboons etc in their
            natural habitat. I've come this &lt;------------------------------&gt; close to a pack of lions and an
            elephant, which was pretty amazing! They don't even bat an eyelid though, they barely realise you're there.
            I can't wait to see the photos <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18"
                                                alt=":-)"/><br/>
            <br/>
            I've come to really appreciate toilets that flush and showers - whether their hot or cold, it doesn't
            matter! Camping in the Serengeti though was pretty special, watching the sun rise through the acacia trees,
            knowing there are animals all around you.<br/>
            <br/>
            This next week I'm staying at a children's orphanage in Moshi, where we spend the morning laburing to help
            build the orphanage (although I think it's mostly built now) then playing with the kids in the afternoon. I
            can't wait!<br/>
            <br/>
            Suffice to say I'm really glad I'm here and really recommend Intrepid Guerba as a tour company, everything
            is really well organised. I can't believe I've only been here a week!<br/>
            <br/>
            Anyway, I'd better go and find the others, organise some lunch then find our bus to Moshi.

            Travelling
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Well the new job is starting to live up to it's promise of the travel: Yeovil this week, London &amp; Yeovil
            next, Leighton Buzzard soon after - all the exciting places in the world! And some interesting
            hotels...<br/>
            <br/>
            Exciting stuff though, but busy busy busy. And still a lot to learn.<br/>
            <br/>
            My Clio is for sale btw, if you know anyone who's interested I can pass you the details (or look at
            Facebook, they're on there). It's looking for a good home.

            Professional Services Consultant
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Well I'm a week and a half into my new job and it seems to be going well so far... although it's early days
            yet! I've got a wicked company car (Audi A4 S Line 1.9TDi) which I can't park, I'm making lots of new
            friends and living with Helen is fun after I've lived on my own for so long!<br/>
            <br/>
            The only problem at the moment is that my calendar is on my laptop at home (Southampton), and I can't access
            it during the week (in Reading), so I've no idea if I've got any plans for this weekend or not! If I'm meant
            to be somewhere, please let me know...

            Je retourne
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I'm back from France after a fabulous weekend at La Leu, Helen's parents' place half an hour south of
            Poitiers celebrating Helen &amp; Linden's engagement. Lots of chatting, lots of drinking and lots of fun was
            the name of the game <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/04.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-D"/> <br/>
            <br/>
            Petanque was the main entertainment, closely followed by frisbee and poker/cards on wet Sunday (and Dave
            when he'd had a few French lagers). I didn't do or see an awful lot, as I had too many people to catch up
            with, but I managed to squeeze in a couple of dips in the pool, a few games of frisbee, darts, table tennis
            and lots of eating and drinking. <br/>
            <br/>
            Thanks to Linden and Helen for hosting the weekend and making us all feel welcome and comfortable. Photos
            can be viewed on Facebook <a

            Bienvenue en France
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            A vendredi, je vais allais en France avec beaucoup de mes amis pour celebrer l'engagement de Linden et
            Helen. Bring it on!<br/>
            <br/>
            Let's hope the weather improves though, apparently it's quite wet out there at the moment <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/02.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-("/> Not great weather for BBQ-ing
            and lounging by the pool. Ah well, nous sommes anglais!
