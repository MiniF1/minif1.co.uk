            My lovely car is sadly costing me a fortune at the moment, both in terms of money and stress. <br/>
            <br/>
            In August the rear silencer fell off <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/09.png" width="18" height="18"
                                                      alt=":-o"/> - it had rusted through, yet the car was only 2 and a
            half years old! I had it replaced by Renault (at great cost), and after writing a letter they finally
            refunded me the money as it is still in warranty (it's 3 years old at the end of this month). <br/>
            <br/>
            Then a few weeks ago it fell off again <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/10.png" width="18" height="18"
                                                        alt=":angry:"/> - this time the bit they had connected it to
            rusted through. So fortunately Renault replaced the centre section, at their cost. However they didn't
            replace the rubber bracket that it suspends from, which 2 days later perished and collapsed (more on that in
            a bit).<br/>
            <br/>
            On top of all this, the car needs new brake discs and pads all round. After getting a quote from Renault to
            get the front ones done, I decided I couldn't afford to remortgage, so I took the car back home and Dad
            &amp; I replaced the front ones last weekend; the next ones will be done this weekend. <br/>
            <br/>
            While taking the wheels off to do the job, we found two tyres with nails in. We removed one and the tyre was
            fine. However, the second one left a hole and the tyre went down. The problem here was that the car doesn't
            have a spare. As it is the Cup edition, i.e. the lighter version for track days, Renault decided the spare
            wheel was something that could be dispensed with, and replaced it instead with two cans of tyre mousse. So
            we had no choice but to use the tyre mousse to re-inflate the tyre and seal the hole.<br/>
            <br/>
            And herein lay the next problem. The tyre mousse didn't work... Neither did it inflate the tyre nor seal the
            hole. And it was 3.30pm on a Sunday afternoon. We rushed to Kwik Fit and Halfords to get advice on tyre
            mousse before they shut (does it have an expiry date? is it a permanent fix?), but no-one knew anything
            about it. So we called my uncle, who very kindly offered me the use of the spare wheel from his Clio Sport
            to get me back down to Southampton ready for work on Monday morning.<br/>
            <br/>
            On Monday I took my deflated tyre to the garage to get it repaired. However, as soon as I mentioned that I
            had put tyre mousse in there, they said they couldn't repair it, as the mousse would stop the glue from
            bonding with the tyre. So that cost me a tyre.<br/>
            <br/>
            So I'm back on the road now, with the exhaust held in place by a bit of rubber found in the depths of Dad's
            garage, secured by a tie wrap (the only place I can get a replacement bracket is from the main dealer, i.e.
            Renault and I dread to think how much they'll charge for a bit of rubber <img class="inline"
                                                                                          src="img/smilies/05.png"
                                                                                          width="18" height="18"
                                                                                          alt=":-?"/> ). <br/>
            <br/>
            As the car reaches it's 3rd birthday in 2 weeks (the day before my birthday!) it is due it's first MoT. And
            guess what - the price of an MoT went up by 6 quid last week - d'oh! And I ought to get it serviced by
            Renault before the warranty expires, just in case anything else is about to wear out on it, heaven forbid.
            And that doesn't come cheap... <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/13.png" width="18" height="18"
                                                alt=":cry:"/><br/>
            <br/>
            Anyone got any jobs going? Or a winning lottery ticket??? If the car wasn't so stunningly gorgeous or fun to
            drive, I'd have put the ads up by now... any takers?
