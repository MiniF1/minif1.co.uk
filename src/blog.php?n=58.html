            Fastest lady!
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I competed in my first Autosolo last Sunday, along with Michael and Keith. This is an event similar to an
            Autotest, except on tarmac, with longer tests at higher average speeds. It was held at Barton Stacey, the
            same venue as the rally practise day we did a few weeks back. We had 12 runs, 3 on each of 4 tests with the
            best 2 runs to count.<br/>
            <br/>
            The entry list was maxed out at 45, so there were plenty of people there in a wide variety of cars,
            including MGB GT V8s, Austin Healeys, a Clan Crusader, a Sylva Striker, a Peugeot 306 GTi V6, a Rover 220
            Tomcat, Golf GTi's, Peugeot 205s, Vauxhall Novas, Lotus Elises, Minis and 2 Clio Renaultsports (myself and
            Michael), to name but a few.<br/>
            <br/>
            I had a fabulous day, with a combination of marshaling, spectating and competing in rotations. My times
            improved steadily throughout the day, and although the competition from the 3 other females in the
            competition was tough and were were quite close on a lot of the tests, my consistency won through and I was
            presented with the Fastest Lady award at the end of the day. I achieved 22nd overall, out of 45 which I
            think is pretty impressive for my first event <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/04.png" width="18"

            Over 2000cc class too, so it was a successful day for Team Grubb. Thanks for Dad for his part in organising
            the event, you made a great Assistant Clerk of the Course!<br/>
