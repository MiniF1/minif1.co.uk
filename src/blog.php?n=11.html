        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Wow I have been busy recently. A weekend in London visiting lots of old friends I haven't seen for a while,
            traumas trying to replace the rear brakes on my car and a day driving my Dad's Porsche and my uncle's
            Renault Clio 172 around Castle Combe racing circuit. Then 4 days at work...<br/>
            <br/>
            Then Grandma's 80th birthday party, which to me was a reunion of cousins - the first time all 10 of us were
            in one place in quite a few years, which was a good opportunity to catch up. Then three days at work...<br/>
            <br/>
            Then last thursday I was off to Wales for the annual trip to the British round of the World Rally
            Championships (moved forward to September this year from November). This year though I was on my own, as so
            many of my fellow marshalls from the CSMA North London Marshall Team had boycotted the event for various
            reasons. Once I got past the traumas of thursday night and trying to find where I was supposed to be and the
            people I was working with, it all went smoothly. Friday was absolutely knackering but by far the best day,
            mingling with the co-drivers and organising everyone (I think I get my bossy streak from my Mum!). Saturday
            &amp; Sunday at Margam were a doddle after friday, then it was home and back to work...<br/>
            <br/>
            And what's in store this weekend? Hopefully a day trip to Chessington World of Adventures with Maz &amp; Liz
            from work. Blimey it's been a few years since I've been there, but it's always a good laugh!<br/>
            <br/>
            Ooh, and here's some exciting news - Gemma &amp; Dan are engaged! How excited am I! Even though we saw it
            coming for ages <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"/> They make
            such a lovely couple, I wish them both all the best.<br/>
            <br/>
            That's it from me for now. I really ought to get some more photos up here though didn't I. Ok, I'll work on
            it.
