            My new motto
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            My new motto:<br/>
            <br/>
            Life should NOT be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in an attractive and well
            preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, chocolate in one hand, wine in the other, body thoroughly
            used up, totally worn out and screaming &quot;WOO HOO what a ride!&quot;

            Lodger
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I've got a lodger! He's called Scotty, he moved in on Sunday and he's a friend of a friend. It's strange to
            have someone around the house, but I quite like having the company and the money will definitely come in
            useful.

            Happy New Year
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I hope everyone had a fun-filled Christmas with your loved ones, and that you ate, drank and were very merry
            <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"/> We had the usual family
            affair, where Mum surpassed herself once again by cooking a lovely meal for the masses (thanks Mum) and we
            all ate too much and played fun, yet intellectual, games.<br/>
            <br/>
            So now we look forward to Sunday, marking the passing of another year and the beginning of a fresh new one.
            May it bring you all new hopes and new opportunities, and another list of New Year's resolutions that don't
            last beyond a week.<br/>
            <br/>
            Peace and goodwill to all,<br/>
            <br/>
            Caroline.

            About time....
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Sorry folks, it's been too long since the last post. No excuse! <br/>
            <br/>
            I've been busy being a houseowner, getting down and dirty with decorating. I pretty much finished the second
            bedroom (just a bit of painting above the picture rail to do) - enough that I could move into it and start
            on the next room. My bedroom is now about the same colour as the purple this is written on ('sugared lilac'
            I should say). But it is empty apart from a bed, lying in bits on the floor. It's a long story...<br/>
            <br/>
            But the good news is that my sofas arrived last week! So the garden chairs are back where they belong: in
            the garden (and one in the study, and one in the kitchen...). I feel I can invite people round now, as they
            have somewhere to sit! The house is beginning to feel like a home now.

            Settling in
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I just realised I haven't written anything on here for a while, as I've been so caught up with the house!
            Things are coming along nicely. I've got this week off work, so Dad has been helping me attack the first
            room. Monday saw us strip the wallpaper and polyfilla a few holes, plus we mowed the wilderness and turned
            it into something resembling a lawn (a very yellow and strawlike lawn, but it's getting there!). Yesterday I
            sanded the polyfilla down, and today Dad was back again to help hang the wallpaper. We've managed to get the
            whole room done, it's looking bigger and brighter already! Phase 3 is on Friday, when Mum, Grandma and
            Siobhan are coming down to help me paint the room and also do some more on the garden (which will hopefully
            include doing something drastic with the eucalytpus tree which is growing far too fast and threatening to
            take over). Not bad for a week methinks!<br/>
            <br/>
            I now have a bed, a single one which was kindly donated to me by Yvette from badminton (between her and
            Barrie I have gained a lot of stuff, I think their houses must be pretty empty!) so I'm sleeping in relative
            comfort. I'm still missing a sofa, but it's difficult to find one I like that's small enough to fit in the
            bay window. But with Marion &amp; Neil's kind houswarming present (4 folding garden chairs), at least I have
            seating capability now! It's all coming together...<br/>
            <br/>
            Thanks to all those who came to the housewarming party, it was lovely to see you all, even if I did spend
            most of the time giving guests the Grand Tour! Thanks also for the lovely e-mails and cards from those who
            couldn't make it.

            I'm in!
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Guess what - I'm a homeowner! I am officially in grown-up territory now <img class="inline"
                                                                                         src="img/smilies/04.png"
                                                                                         width="18" height="18"
                                                                                         alt=":-D"/> I got the keys and
            moved in yesterday, and spent the first night in my very own home last night! I love it, it's fantastic <img
                class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18" height="18" alt=":-)"/> I have a garden, a shed, a
            loft, a drive, and a hefty debt (but I'm glossing over that for the time being) and it's great! I totally
            recommend it.<br/>
            <br/>
            I'm very lucky, as the house was let out before it was put up for sale, and a lot of stuff was therefore
            left behind, including a fridge, freezer, cooker (gas, hoorah!), washing machine, ironing board, curtains,
            lights, lampshades (although most of those will be going as soon as I can replace them, especially the
            frilly flowery ones!), washing line, BBQ, satellite dish... However, I am in need of a bed and a sofa to
            make it really habitable. Once I've got those, I think I'll really be settled in.<br/>
            <br/>
            So anyone who's around the Southampton area at any time, please pop in and say hi! I have a couple of spare
            mugs and a working (if old and decrepit) kettle, so I can provide cups of tea and coffee; although if
            there's more than two of you you might have to bring your own chairs... I have two garden chairs and a bean
            bag to sit on at the moment!

            Result!
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            Well folks, good news - I exchanged contracts on my house today! At long last... <img class="inline"
                                                                                                  src="img/smilies/04.png"
                                                                                                  width="18" height="18"
                                                                                                  alt=":-D"/> <br/>
            <br/>
            Completion day is on Tuesday, the last day of the month - talk about cutting it fine! Kerry very kindly
            offered to let me stay on the sofa if it didn't go through for Tuesday, but it seems I'll be sleeping on the
            floor in an empty house instead! Perhaps my first purchase should be a bed... <img class="inline"
                                                                                               src="img/smilies/03.png"
                                                                                               width="18" height="18"
                                                                                               alt=";-)"/><br/>
            <br/>
            Cor blimey, that was a long, involved process. It'll be pretty much 12 weeks by the time I move in - and my
            estate agent reckoned it could happen in 6 weeks being as I had no chain! How wrong... But hey, we got
            there. Well, we will on Tuesday at least, fingers crossed!<br/>
            <br/>
            And just in time for the BBQ season too, fantastic <img class="inline" src="img/smilies/01.png" width="18"
                                                                    height="18" alt=":-)"/>

            Snail's pace
        </p>
        <p class="newsBlurb">
            I'm finding the house-buying process incredibly slow... I've signed a contract, got the mortgage offer, got
            the deposit ready, basically got everything in place that I can. I spoke to my solicitors last week, and
            we're now waiting to hear back from the seller with answers to a list of questions we put to him. Once we've
            got satisfactory answers (which very rarely happens first time apparently), we can then set dates for
            exchange etc. <br/>
            <br/>
            It's been 8 weeks already, and I'm getting very nervous as I've got to be out of my flat by the end of May!
            Fingers crossed it will all go ok....!
